Tomcat Repository and Release Structure
---------------------------------------

We will have the following types of releases (or builds):

   1 Final releases. These will be of the form x.y.

   2 Milestone releases. These are of the form x.yMz. Milestone
     releases are not supposed to be used in production
     environments. Before final releases of the form x.y there will be
     milestone builds. (We will define what the milestones are for
     Tomcat 3.1.) 

   3 Bug fix releases (after final releases). These will have two '.'s
     in them. People that care about production use will pick x.y.z
     where 'y' indicates the last stable release and the greatest
     value of 'z' that is available. There will be no milestone
     releases between a final release and subsequent bug fix
     releases.

   4 Nightly releases. These are volatile "dynamite" builds. These are
     just for the current branch and not between a final release and
     subsequent bug fix releases.

Miscellaneous points:

1 Everything except nightly releases are tagged. 

2 Patches should be submitted with a tag, unless it is obvious. 

3 Source drops will be available for the last stable release and the
  current main branch. 

4 The PMC (with feedback and involvement on tomcat-dev) decides if it
  is a "go" for a final or bugfix release.

Release names are of the form x.y[.z]:

x: API version changes (x >= 3)
y: Non-API features (y >= 0)
z: Bug fixes (z >= 0 and is ommitted if z == 0)

See the following tree for the Tomcat plan. The goal is to meet 3.1 by
ApacheCon. A proposal for the feature list for 3.1 (and its
milestones) will come later.

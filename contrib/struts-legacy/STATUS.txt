Struts Legacy Distribution
=======================================================================

This distribution contains classes which have been removed from the
core Struts distribution but may still be of interest.

The classes are considered "stable" but are *not* actively maintained.
(Hence, the name "legacy".)

This distribution can be built against Java 1.3 or Java 1.4.

To provide best compatiblity, Java 1.3 is the default.

The target JDK may be changed by copying "build.properties.sample"
as "build.properties" and making the appropriate changes.

Overview
---------
The Validation Framework was made to work with Struts. It can perform basic validations to check if a field
is required, matches a regular expression, email, credit card, and server side type checking and date
validation. Different validation rules can be defined for different locales. The framework has basic support for
user defined constants which can be used in some field attributes. The validation routines are modifiable in
the validation.xml file so custom validation routines can be created and added to the framework.

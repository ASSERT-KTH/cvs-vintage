                Tiles (formerly Components)
                ===========================

This document contains notes that have been accumulated on getting the Tiles
framework (documentation and example) running in a variety of servlet
container environments.

For most containers, you need only to:

* Copy the WAR files in your Tiles < /webapp > directory to your containers
  < webapps > directory.

* In some cases, you may need to restart your container if it is running.

Tiles instalation is similar to Struts instalation.
This install file is inspire from Struts INSTALL file. Please check the original file 
for hint to install Tiles on others containers. 

Tiles framework will be distributed with Struts, it is also available, with additional 
resources, on following web site  :

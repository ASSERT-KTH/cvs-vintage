  <shortDescription>Struts Jericho 2.x Whiteboard</shortDescription>
  <description>
      Jericho is a whiteboard proposal describing one possible implementation of Struts 2.x.
      Since Struts 2.x is slated as a "revolution", the Apache practice is to assign a codename to a proposal
      until the Community comes to a consensus.
      This proposal is called "Jericho" since it tries to tear-down the walls within the Struts architecture.

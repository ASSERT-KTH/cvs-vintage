<!ENTITY % AttributeName "CDATA">


<!-- A "PropObject" is the identifier of an object, such as a form,
     and also serves as the name of the corresponding scripting variable
     and the name of the attribute under which the object is accessed.
     Therefore, it must conform to the rules for an Identifier.

     defines the location of a resource relative to the location of the
     Struts configuration file itself.

     a lower case letter and contain only characters that are legal in a
     identifier.

                     megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.

     memFileSize     The maximum size (in bytes) of a file whose contents will
                     be retained in memory after uploading. Files larger than
                     this threshold will be written to some alternative storage
                     medium, typically a hard disk. Can be expressed as a number
                     followed by a "K", "M", or "G", which are interpreted to

     pagePattern     Replacement pattern defining how the "page" attribute of
                     custom tags using it is mapped to a context-relative URL
                     of the corresponding resource.  This value may consist of
                     any combination of the following:
                     - "$M" - Replaced by the module prefix of this module
                     - "$P" - Replaced by the value of the "page" attribute
                     - "$$" - Causes a literal dollar sign to be rendered

<!-- The <mapping> element describes an Mapping object that is to be used
     to process a request. The following attributes are defined:

     name            A unique identifier for this exception element so that it
                     can be referenced by an "extends" attribute. (This is *not*
                     a reference to a <form> element!)

     extends         Name of an <mapping> element that is used as a value template
                     for this element. All attributes from the template are available
                     to the new element. Any attribute inherited from the template
                     can be overridden by providing a new value.

     config          The fully qualified class name of the Mapping object to use
                     with this instance. Defaults to the type specified by the
                     enclosing <mappings> element or to
                     "org.apache.struts.core.MappingBase" if not specified.
                     ["org.apache.struts.core.MappingBase"]

     command         Name of a Command to execute in order to process this
                     request. The Command is passed a StrutsContext object wrapping
                     the request. If the Command returns "false", the Location
                     object is processed to complete the response.
                     (org.apache.struts.action.Action now implements Command
                     and provides default behavior for backward compatibility.)

     forward         Location indicating some other resource that will process this
                     request, instead of a FormHandler class specified by "handler".
                     Exactly one of "command", "forward", or "include" must be
                     specified.

     include         Location indicating some other resource that will process this
                     request, instead of a FormHandler class specified by "handler".
                     Exactly one of "command", "forward", or "include" must be
                     specified.

     matches         The path to match against the submitted request,
                     starting with a "/" character, and without the filename extension
                     if extension mapping is used.

                     NOTE:  Do *not* include a period in your path name,
                     because it will look like a filename extension and
                     may cause your Mapping not to found.

    processor        Name of a Processor object to use when handling this request.
                     If not specified, the "unnamed" processor is used.

    default          Set to "true" if this object should be configured as the
                     default mapping. If a request does not match another mapping,
                     it will be passed to the Mapping object with default set to
                     "true". Only one Mapping can be marked as "default" within a
                     module.
                     [false]

     secure          whether to force secure access to this mapping (via SSL).

     roles           Comma-delimited list of security role names that are allowed
                     access to this Mapping object.

     parameter       General-purpose configuration parameter that can be used to
                     pass extra information to the Command object selected by
                     this mapping.

     attribute       Name of the request-scope or session-scope attribute that
                     is used to access our FormHandler object, if it is other than
                     the object's default "form". Optional if "form" is specified,
                     else not valid.

     form            Name of the form, if any, to use with this mapping.

     scope           The scope ("request" or "session") that is used to
                     access our FormHandler, if any. Optional if "name" is
                     specified, else not valid.

     validate        Set to "true" if the validate method of the FormHandler
                     should be called prior to calling the MappingHandler for this
                     request, or set to "false" if you do not want the
                     validate method called.
                     [true]

     invalid         Name of a local or global Location that should handle the
                     response if a validation message is generated.
                     Valid only when "form" is specified.
                     Required if "form" is specified and the FormHandler returns
                     validation messages.
                     Optional if "form" is specified and the
                     FormHandler does not return validation messages.

     cancel          Name of a local or global Location that should handle the
                     response if "cancel" is signaled in the request.

/**
 * This is the <code>BeanInfo</code> descriptor for the
 * <code>org.apache.strutsel.taglib.logic.ELNotPresentTag</code> class.  It is
 * needed to override the default mapping of custom tag attribute names to
 * class attribute names.
 *<p>
 * This is because the value of the unevaluated EL expression has to be kept
 * separately from the evaluated value, which is stored in the base class. This
 * is related to the fact that the JSP compiler can choose to reuse different
 * tag instances if they received the same original attribute values, and the
 * JSP compiler can choose to not re-call the setter methods, because it can
 * assume the same values are already set.

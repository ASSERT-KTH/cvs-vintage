ServiceManager for Struts framework.
v.0.1
==================
You must do the following to have the build script work.

1. Edit the build.properties file.
2. Replace in web.xml struts standart servlet class
    <servlet-class>org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet</servlet-class>
   to the ServicesServlet - with support of ServiceManager.
    <servlet-class>org.apache.struts.action.ServicesServlet</servlet-class>
3. Add the following to the lib directory.
     Struts - struts.jar (http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/)
     JDBC 2.0 Optonal Package - jdbc2_0-stdext.jar (http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/download.html#spec)

Overview
---------
v.0.1
ServiceManager is a way to make Struts framework pluggable. Main reason to perform this hack
was simple - lets extend Struts framework without needs to extend ActionServlet class.
With ServiceManager each developer can write new service with some additional functions
for Struts framework and plug it into the ServiceManager.

ServiceManager uses single struts-config.xml file to read configuration information
and lets to services add its own rules to the digester to support additional config
sections in struts-config.xml. Another words - ServiceManager uses 'live' Digester! 
Such trick allow to store all needed config info for all services in application in 
one file - struts-config.xml. 

ServiceManger implementation contains one service as sample of services using. This 
service (FactoryService) contains code from my early struts-based package - BeanFactory.
FactoryService intended to support automatic beans generation for any action in application. It
uses different factories to generate beans by different ways. Package contains two
factories - JDBCFactory and RowSetFactory. 

JDBCFactory is really simple and transparent approach to read data from relation data source.
It uses struts-config.xml to register all needed info about queries and parameters for it.
RowSetFactory is experimantal hack to support using of CachedRowSet early access
implementation and forget massive data beans creations - write query, place tags
into jsp and view data from database at pages.

Many thanks to all those struts developers which participated in discussion of the 
questions connected to development ServletManager. Special words for Ron Smith - 
his Extensions servlet give me additional impact to make right solution and choose
roght way. Thanks to Craig R. McClanahan - for words about architecture. Thanks to 
Ted Hasted - for conducting discussion around creation of standart way to make struts
extensions pluggable.

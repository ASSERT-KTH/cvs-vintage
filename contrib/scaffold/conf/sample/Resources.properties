index.title=Struts Starter Application
index.heading=Hello World!
index.message=To get started on your own application, copy the struts-blank.war to a new WAR file using the name for your application. Place it in your container's "webapp" folder (or equivalent), and let your container auto-deploy the application. Edit the skeleton configuration files as needed, reload Struts or restart your container, and you are on your way! You can find the Resources file with this message in the src/conf classes folder. 
DO NOT EDIT THE Resources.properties FILE UNDER classes. Edit the one under src/conf instead! The build file automatically copies the files from under src/conf to classes in order to simplify a clean build.

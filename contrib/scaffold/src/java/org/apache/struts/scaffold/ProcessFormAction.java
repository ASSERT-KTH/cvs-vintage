/**
 * ProcessAction subclass that checks to see if a another
 * bean exists in the request scope before overwriting it.
 * If another bean is present, it is populated from the
 * ProcessBean.
 * <P>
 * Any JavaBean can be used to populate a Struts presentation
 * page, and it is not always necessary to transfer data from
 * a business bean to a form bean.
 * Other times, the form bean will have special helper
 * properties for the benefit of the presentation layer.
 * For example, a second password field may be needed to
 * validate the user's data-entry but would not be part of
 * the business API.
 * <P>
 * The <CODE>ProcessFormAction</CODE> will check to see if
 * another bean is in scope (presumably a form bean).
 * If another bean exists, ProcessFormAction populates it
 * from the business bean,
 * The net result is an automatic data transfer from a
 * business bean to the form bean.

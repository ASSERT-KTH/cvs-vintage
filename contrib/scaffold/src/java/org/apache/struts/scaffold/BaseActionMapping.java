     * Adds submitPath to RequestActionMapping.
     *
     * This is useful when using one mapping to acquire a
     * blank or prepopulated form, and then submitting that
     * form to another mapping to complete the insert or update.
     *
     * It is also useful when reusing the same base form
     * or result list in different workflows.
     * Each mapping can indicate where to return,
     * for its own workflow.
     *
     * The current mapping is stored in the request under
     * the Globals.MAPPING_KEY (or the equivalent Struts 1.0
     * Action.MAPPING_KEY).
     *
     * You can access this property, or any mapping property,
     * using <bean:define>, or the equivalent, and then using
     * a Runtime Expression to use the property with the
     * <code>action</code> property of the html:form tag.
     *
     * To modify runtime behavior depending on whether returnPath
     * has been set, use the <logic:present> tag to either
     * use the returnPath or some alternate property.
     *
     * To use more than one-time property in a response,
     * pass a helper bean from the action instead.

       dot release of Tomcat.  Nothing in this document should be

			Tomcat 3.2 Release Plan
			=======================

Objective: 

    The objective of the 3.2 release is to continue the improvement
    in quality, performance, and functionality of the Tomcat servlet
    container, enabling us to deliver a high quality, production ready,
    release by JavaOne 2000.

    The Tomcat 3.2 release cycle has two intermediate milestones (with
    "burn in" periods for both), after which it will be qualified as
    Beta.  The target release date for the final release is June 5, 2000.

Tomcat 3.2 Milestone 1 Release:

	Code Freeze/Tag Date:	April 21, 2000
	Release Manager:	???

    The following action items from the STATUS.html file shall be
    completed and tested for this release:

	TODO - copy agreed upon items from the status file

Tomcat 3.2 Milestone 2 Release:

	Code Freeze/Tag Date:	May 5, 2000
	Release Manager:	???

    At this point, development of new features on the main CVS branch
    should be suspended, and the focus changed to fixing outstanding
    bugs in preparation for the final release.

Tomcat 3.2 Final Release

    again for enhancements and changes targeted at future releases.

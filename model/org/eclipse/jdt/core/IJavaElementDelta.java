/**
 * A Java element delta describes changes in Java element between two discrete
 * points in time.  Given a delta, clients can access the element that has 
 * changed, and any children that have changed.
 * <p>
 * Deltas have a different status depending on the kind of change they represent.  
 * The list below summarizes each status (as returned by <code>getKind</code>)
 * and its meaning:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>ADDED</code> - The element described by the delta 
 * has been added. Additional information is specified by
 * <code>getFlags</code> which returns <code>F_ADDED_TO_CLASSPATH</code>
 * if the element added is a package fragment root on the classpath.</li>
 * <li><code>REMOVED</code> - The element described by the delta 
 * has been removed. Additional information is specified by
 * <code>getFlags</code> which returns <code>F_REMOVED_FROM_CLASSPATH</code>
 * if the element removed was a package fragment root on the classpath.</li>
 * <li><code>CHANGED</code> - The element described by the delta 
 * has been changed in some way.  Specification of the type of change is provided
 * by <code>getFlags</code> which returns the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>F_CONTENT</code> - The contents of the element have been altered.  This flag
 * is only valid for elements which correspond to files.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CHILDREN</code> - A child of the element has changed in some way.  This flag
 * is only valid if the element is an <code>IParent</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_MODIFIERS</code> - the modifiers on the element have changed in some way. 
 * This flag is only valid if the element is an <code>IMember</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_OPENED</code> - the underlying <code>IProject</code>
 * has been opened. This flag is only valid if the element is an <code>IJavaModel</code>
 * or an <code>IJavaProject</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CLOSED</code> - the underlying <code>IProject</code>
 * has been closed. This flag is only valid if the element is an <code>IJavaModel</code>
 * or an <code>IJavaProject</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Move operations are indicated by other change flags, layered on top
 * of the change flags described above. If element A is moved to become B,
 * the delta for the  change in A will have status <code>REMOVED</code>,
 * with change flag <code>F_MOVED_TO</code>. In this case,
 * <code>getMovedToElement</code> on delta A will return the handle for B.
 * The  delta for B will have status <code>ADDED</code>, with change flag
 * <code>F_MOVED_FROM</code>, and <code>getMovedFromElement</code> on delta
 * B will return the handle for A. (Note, the handle to A in this case represents
 * an element that no longer exists).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the move change flags only describe the changes to a single element, they
 * do not imply anything about the parent or children of the element.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following flags describe changes in an <code>IJavaProject</code>'s classpath:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>F_ADDED_TO_CLASSPATH</code> - the element described by the delta has been added to the
 *	classpath.</li>
 * <li><code>F_REMOVED_FROM_CLASSPATH</code> - the element described by the delta has been removed
 * from the classpath.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CLASSPATH_REORDER</code> - the element described by the delta has changed its
 * position in the classpath.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>IJavaElementDelta</code> object are not valid outside the dynamic scope
 * of the notification.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>

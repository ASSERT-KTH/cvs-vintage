 * Represent the root Java element corresponding to the workspace.

 * The Java model element has no parent (it is the root of the Java element 
 * hierarchy). Its children are <code>IJavaProject</code>s.

 * This interface provides methods for performing copy, move, rename, and
 * delete operations on multiple Java elements.

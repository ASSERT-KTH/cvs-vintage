/** 
 * An entry on a Java project classpath identifying one or more package fragment
 * roots. A classpath entry has a content kind (either source, 
 * <code>K_SOURCE</code>, or binary, <code>K_BINARY</code>), which is inherited
 * by each package fragment root and package fragment associated with the entry.
 * <p>
 * A classpath entry can refer to any of the following:<ul>
 * 
 *	<li>Source code in the current project. In this case, the entry identifies a
 *		root folder in the current project containing package fragments and
 *		<code>.java</code> source files. The root folder itself represents a default
 *		package, subfolders represent package fragments, and <code>.java</code> files
 *		represent compilation units. All compilation units will be compiled when
 * 		the project is built. The classpath entry must specify the
 *		absolute path to the root folder. Entries of this kind are 
 *		associated with the <code>CPE_SOURCE</code> constant.</li>
 * 
 *	<li>A binary library in the current project, in another project, or in the external
 *		file system. In this case the entry identifies a JAR (or root folder) containing
 *		package fragments and <code>.class</code> files.  The classpath entry
 *		must specify the absolute path to the JAR (or root folder), and in case it refers
 *		to an external JAR, then there is no associated resource in the workbench. Entries 
 *		of this kind are associated with the <code>CPE_LIBRARY</code> constant.</li>
 * 
 *	<li>A required project. In this case the entry identifies another project in
 *		the workspace. The required project is used as a binary library when compiling
 *		(that is, the builder looks in the output location of the required project
 *		for required <code>.class</code> files when building). When performing other
 *		"development" operations - such as code assist, code resolve, type hierarchy
 *		creation, etc. - the source code of the project is referred to. Thus, development
 *		is performed against a required project's source code, and compilation is 
 *		performed against a required project's last built state.  The
 *		classpath entry must specify the absolute path to the
 *		project. Entries of this kind are  associated with the <code>CPE_PROJECT</code>
 *		constant. 
 * 		Note: referencing a required project with a classpath entry refers to the source 
 *     code or associated <code>.class</code> files located in its output location. 
 *     It will also automatically include any other libraries or projects that the required project's classpath 
 *     refers to, iff the corresponding classpath entries are tagged as being exported 
 *     (<code>IClasspathEntry#isExported</code>). 
 *    Unless exporting some classpath entries, classpaths are not chained by default - 
 *    each project must specify its own classpath in its entirety.</li>
 * 
 *  <li> A path beginning in a classpath variable defined globally to the workspace.
 *		Entries of this kind are  associated with the <code>CPE_VARIABLE</code> constant.  
 *      Classpath variables are created using <code>JavaCore#setClasspathVariable</code>,
 * 		and gets resolved, to either a project or library entry, using
 *      <code>JavaCore#getResolvedClasspathVariable</code>.
 *		It is also possible to register an automatic initializer (<code>ClasspathVariableInitializer</code>),
 * 	which will be invoked through the extension point "org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathVariableInitializer".
 * 	After resolution, a classpath variable entry may either correspond to a project or a library entry. </li>
 * 
 *  <li> A named classpath container identified by its container path.
 *     A classpath container provides a way to indirectly reference a set of classpath entries through
 *     a classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_CONTAINER</code>. Typically, a classpath container can
 *     be used to describe a complex library composed of multiple JARs, projects or classpath variables,
 *     considering also that containers can be mapped differently on each project. Several projects can
 *     reference the same generic container path, but have each of them actually bound to a different
 *     container object.
 *     The container path is a formed by a first ID segment followed with extra segments, 
 *     which can be used as additional hints for resolving this container reference. If no container was ever 
 *     recorded for this container path onto this project (using <code>setClasspathContainer</code>, 
 * 	then a <code>ClasspathContainerInitializer</code> will be activated if any was registered for this 
 * 	container ID onto the extension point "org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathContainerInitializer".
 * 	A classpath container entry can be resolved explicitly using <code>JavaCore#getClasspathContainer</code>
 * 	and the resulting container entries can contain any non-container entry. In particular, it may contain variable
 *     entries, which in turn needs to be resolved before being directly used. 
 * 	<br> Also note that the container resolution APIs include an IJavaProject argument, so as to allow the same
 * 	container path to be interpreted in different ways for different projects. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * The result of <code>IJavaProject#getResolvedClasspath</code> will have all entries of type
 * <code>CPE_VARIABLE</code> and <code>CPE_CONTAINER</code> resolved to a set of 
 * <code>CPE_SOURCE</code>, <code>CPE_LIBRARY</code> or <code>CPE_PROJECT</code>
 * classpath entries.
 * <p>
 * Any classpath entry other than a source folder (kind <code>CPE_SOURCE</code>) can
 * be marked as being exported. Exported entries are automatically contributed to
 * dependent projects, along with the project's output folder, which is implicitly
 * exported. The project's output folder is always listed first, followed by the
 * any exported entries.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * Classpath entries can be created via methods on <code>JavaCore</code>.

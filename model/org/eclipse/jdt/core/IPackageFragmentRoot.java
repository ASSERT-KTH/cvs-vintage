/**
 * A package fragment root contains a set of package fragments.
 * It corresponds to an underlying resource which is either a folder,
 * JAR, or zip.  In the case of a folder, all descendant folders represent
 * package fragments.  For a given child folder representing a package fragment, 
 * the corresponding package name is composed of the folder names between the folder 
 * for this root and the child folder representing the package, separated by '.'.
 * In the case of a JAR or zip, the contents of the archive dictates 
 * the set of package fragments in an analogous manner.
 * Package fragment roots need to be opened before they can be navigated or manipulated.
 * The children are of type <code>IPackageFragment</code>, and are in no particular order.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

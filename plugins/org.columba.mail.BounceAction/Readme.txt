1. Introduction

When receiving spam messages, one can use the bounce plugin to send this
message back to the sender without touching the headers. This way the sender
should be tricked to believe that the recipients address doesn't exist.


2. Installation
Select Utilities->Plugin Manager to open the Plugin Manager Dialog. Select the
"Install..." button which opens a dialog where you have to choose the location
of the zip-file containing your plugin.

3. Usage
You will find a new menuentry in Message->Bounce Message. Just select
a message you wanna bounce back to its sender.

	 * Description: A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of component

	 * individual calendar. Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval
	 * in a search for busy time. Alternately, the event can have its Time
	 * Transparency set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent blocking of the
	 * event in searches for busy time.
	 * <p>

	 * specified as a DATE value also. The anniversary type of "VEVENT" can span

	 * generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is unique.
	 * There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish this. The
	 * identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the [RFC822]
	 * addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness is to put the domain name
	 * or a domain literal IP address of the host on which the identifier was
	 * created on the right hand side of the "@", and on the left hand side, put
	 * a combination of the current calendar date and time of day (i.e.,
	 * formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some other currently unique
	 * (perhaps sequential) identifier available on the system (for example, a
	 * process id number). Using a date/time value on the left hand side and a
	 * domain name or domain literal on the right hand side makes it possible to
	 * guarantee uniqueness since no two hosts should be using the same domain
	 * name or IP address at the same time. Though other algorithms will work,
	 * it is RECOMMENDED that the right hand side contain some domain identifier
	 * (either of the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the
	 * message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side
	 * within the scope of that domain.

	 * 
	 * The full range of calendar components specified by a recurrence set is
	 * referenced by referring to just the "UID" property value corresponding to
	 * the calendar component. The "RECURRENCE-ID" property allows the reference
	 * to an individual instance within the recurrence set.
	 *

	 * Description: The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing the

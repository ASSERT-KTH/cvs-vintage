1. Introduction

This folder action marks a folder as read. ie, all unread emails
are marked as read. This is handy when you are on large volume
mailinglists and dont really care about all posts, just a few.

2. Installation
elect Utilities->Plugin Manager to open the Plugin Manager Dialog. Select the
"Install..." button which opens a dialog where you have to choose the location
of the zip-file containing your plugin.

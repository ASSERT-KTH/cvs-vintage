	<h2>Scarab version numbering</h2>

<p>
Previously scarab has been using version numbering like 1.0b1, 1.0b12, etc.,
to mean a progression towards a 1.0 release.  We are going to switch to a 
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH numbering scheme which is followed by the Subversion tigris 
project, and which is detailed in the 
<a href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html">
Apache Portable Runtime project</a>.  The APR document does not cover
changes to data storage and is primarily concerned with API stability.
</p>

<p>
As the APR document leaves the 0.x.y versioning somewhat undefined, some 
clarifications are in order. 
<ol>
<li>There is no change in policy between the
1.0b15 release and 0.15.1.  The old informal policy that the API can change but
users of the application via the web interface should be able to update the
scarab version and have some form of data migration path via an 
sql upgrade script, ant task, or in worst case manual instructions is still
in place.  Though it must be kept in mind that this is an open source project
and time constraints can lead to situations like where Oracle 8i support was
broken abruptly.  There are no guarantees.</li>
<li>Any release following a change in database schema or other data 
storage requires an increase in the MINOR version number.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
This change of versioning is partly to avoid a situation where we are have
version numbers like 1.0b56.  Scarab's APIs still have a bit of work to go before we will want to release a 1.0 version of the project and a clearly defined
API is the biggest obstacle remaining for such a release.  This is going to 
become a priority of the CollabNet developers on the project fairly soon, i.e. June 2003, but could take some time to complete.
</p>

<p>It is anticipated that this change in versioning will lead to many more 
patch level releases that will fix bugs, so it should be beneficial to users.

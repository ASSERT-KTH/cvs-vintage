<h2>Scarab version numbering</h2>

<p>Originally, Scarab used version labeling like 1.0b1, 1.0b12, etc.,
to mean a progression towards a 1.0 release.  We've since changed to
a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH numbering scheme (also followed by the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> project), which is
<a href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html">detailed</a> by the
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project.  The APR document does not
cover changes to data storage, and is primarily concerned with API
stability.  Both labeling schemes are leading towards the same goal,
the release of Scarab 1.0 final.</p>

<p>As the APR document leaves the 0.x.y versioning somewhat undefined
(being past that stage), some clarifications are in order.

<ol>
  <li>There is no change in policy between the 1.0b15 release and
    0.15.1.  The old informal policy that the API can change but users
    of the application (via the web interface) should be able to
    update their Scarab version and have some form of data migration
    path via an SQL upgrade script, Ant task, or (in the worst case)
    manual instructions, is still in place.  Please keep in mind that
    this is an open source project, and time constraints can lead to
    situations like where Oracle 8i support was broken abruptly. There
    are no guarantees.</li>

  <li>Any release following a change in database schema or other data 
    storage requires an increase in the MINOR version number.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>This change of versioning is partly to avoid a situation where we
are have version numbers like 1.0b56.  Scarab's APIs are evolving at a
more rapid rate than is desirable for final release of a version 1.0.
A clearly defined API and a comprehensive functional specification are
the biggest obstacles between Scarab and such a release.  These tasks
are going to become a priority of the CollabNet developers on the
project fairly soon, i.e. June 2003, but could take some time to
complete.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that this change in versioning will lead to many
more patch level releases that will fix bugs, so it should be
beneficial to users.</p>

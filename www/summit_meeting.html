This is to announce the first ever Scarab/Turbine Summit Meeting. The purpose of 
this meeting is: 
<ul>
    <li> discuss the development of Scarab</li>
    <li> discuss the development of Turbine</li>
    <li> training on WebMacro/Turbine development (Model 2+1) *</li>
    <li> put faces to email addresses</li>
    <li> see where the collab.net magic happens</li>
    <li> take a vacation to San Francisco? :-)</li>
    <li> foster the Turbine revolution</li>
</ul>
Mark your calendars for June 19th at 10:00am at <a href="http://www.collab.net">Collab.Net</a> 
offices. This will be an all day event and you can leave whenever you want. I will 
probably do a lot of code walk through and explanation about Turbine and the development 
of Scarab as well as my personal visions for this stuff. Your input on all aspects 
of this stuff will be appreciated. 
<p><a href="http://www.collab.net/">Collab.Net</a>'s offices are here: 
<p>425 2nd St. Floor 5, <br>
    San Francisco, <br>
    CA 94107 <br>
    (P) 415.247.1690 
<p>We are right in the .com SOMA area of San Francisco and about a 10 minute walk 
    from the Montgomery BART station. Taking public transit is highly recommended 
    because finding parking in that area can be a real pain. 
<p>Please RSVP to me &lt;<a href="mailto:jon@latchkey.com">jon@latchkey.com</a>&gt; 
    if you plan on making it so that I can keep a good head count. 
<p>thanks!

<p>* There is a new bit of terminology that I'm going to start referring to. It 
    is called Model 2+1. It is a +1 on the Model 2 development approach that was 
    discussed in this paper: 
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1999/jw-12-ssj-jspmvc.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1999/jw-12-ssj-jspmvc.html</a>&gt; 
<p>I see Turbine fitting right into this model, but also expanding on it quite a 
    bit to provide further support for defining things like a consistent methodology 
    for handling form submission (actions), navigation, screens, etc as well as 
    supporting more than one template language in a consistent manner. Hence, Turbine 
    is now Model 2+1. :-) <br>

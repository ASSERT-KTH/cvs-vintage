<h2>Scarab - Administration Guide</h2>
<h4>$Id: admin-guide.html,v 1.3 2002/05/15 22:41:18 jon Exp $</h4>

<p>
Out of the box, Scarab comes with some default behavior which most 
likely will not be appropriate for your setup. Probably the first
thing that you will notice is that Scarab comes with a few default
user accounts for people who have worked on Scarab. These accounts
all have the password: "1" which, of course, is not secure and 
these accounts should either be disabled or have their passwords 
changed.
</p>

<p>
The next thing that you will want to do is define new Modules as well as
associate Issue Types, Attributes, Attribute Options, etc...all of these
functions can be performed by logging in as a user that has the "Root"
or "Project Owner" role and using the Administration screens to setup
your own installation of Scarab.
</p>

<p>
Use the turbine@tigris.org (prior to b8, it is turbine@collab.net)
id (or define a new id by changing the 'scarab.user.username'
property in your build.properties and re-building) to create
modules. Then create issue types and global attributes, if the
default ones don't meet your needs. Then assign issue types to your
new modules.  Then assign attributes to your issue types.
</p>

<p>
Scarab has a very flexible Issue Type/Attribute system that can be
molded into a variety of shapes and sizes. As time goes on and we get
more <a href="mailto:dev@scarab.tigris.org">feedback</a> from people
using Scarab, we will work to tune the default installation to be as
useful as possible for people and maybe come up with a few different
defaults for various types of uses of Scarab.

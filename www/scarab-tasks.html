<p>These are tasks that will need to be done in order to complete Scarab. The point 
    of this document is to break up the work load into smaller chunks that individuals 
    can do in parallel. At this point, since we don't have the UI, it is difficult 
    to break that into smaller chunks that people can work on directly. When we 
    have that, this page will be updated to reflect who is working on what.</p>

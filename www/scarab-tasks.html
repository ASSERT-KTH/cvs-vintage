    These are tasks that will need to be done in order to complete Scarab. The point 
    of this document is to break up the work load into smaller chunks that individuals 
    can do in parallel.

            Model</a> in the Context. These people will state
            requirements for additions to the API to the Owner of the
            Scarab API.
            <p>
            Jon is starting with the administration screens for 
            Attributes as well as the Start page.

            Others can feel free to pick up a screen and 
            add the fact that they are working on it to this document.

        	ideal where there is the ability to have the granularity
        	where we can a single field within a form and move it to
        	another page (within reason of course) without having to
        	modify a single line of Java back end code to achieve this
        	overall goal. Intake is being developed by John and is in 
        	Turbine's CVS tree in turbine/conf/intake.

        	as adding in Security related join tables.
        	<p>
          	 We also need to figure out the integration between SourceCast 
          	 Projects and Scarab Projects as there is a requirement for
          	 nested projects and SourceCast does not currently support that
          	 where Scarab's SCARAB_MODULE table does via a parent/child 
          	 relationship scheme.

        <td>
            There is an inconsistency within Scarab's schema and
            Turbine's system in that the visitor_id is assumed to be a
            long in Turbine's system and in scarab's it is an int. so,
            in tables like scarab_issue_attribute_vote, there is a
            visitor_id column there that is an int. it should be changed
            to be a long.
            <p>
            we should also change the issue_id column in all of the
            tables to be a long as well.
            <p>
            actually, now that i think about it more...lets use long for
            ALL of our types instead of int for scaling reasons. i don't
            think we need to go as far as BigDecimal though. :-)

<p>
This documents the process for doing a release of Scarab.
</p>

<pre>
#1. Check out a fresh copy of Scarab.

    cvs co scarab

#2. Edit scarab/build/default.properties and change the 
    version number from the -dev to the final version number for the
    release and check this file back into CVS.

#3. Update the scarab/www/index.html file to announce the new release
    as well as update the scarab/www/changelog.html file. 
    Check both these files back into CVS.

#4. Tag cvs with the release tag. Mail the dev@scarab mailing list to
    let people know that they should hold off on commits until the message
    comes through that you are done with the tag/release process.
    Change the version number in the example below to the version of the 
    current release.

    cd scarab
    cvs tag SCARAB_1_0_B15

#5. Build a release. This will create a .tar.gz and a .zip file in
    the scarab directory.

    cd scarab/build
    ant package

#6. Edit scarab/build/default.properties and change the 
    version number from the final version number  to the -dev
    version and check this file back into CVS.

#7. Log into the Scarab website with your account. Go to the
    Downloads area (http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList)
    and move the existing released files into the "Old releases" folder.

#8. Upload the new releases into the "Top" folder.

#9. Announce to the user@scarab,dev@scarab,announce@scarab mailing lists
    that there is a new release available.

#10. Post a new release on the freshmeat.net Scarab entry.

<h3>Importing issue data</h3>

<p>
Scarab has the ability to export XML issues and then import them back
in. For now, there are a lot of pre-requirements in order for this to
happen successfully (see below). We cannot stress strongly enough that
you backup your database before you do this import as the code is in its
early alpha stages. One thing that is known to not work entirely
is the import of the dependency information. I have also not done a
lot of testing of the update-same-db import-type, just the
create-same-db import-type.
</p>

<p>
There are three ways that the import can happen and this is defined by the
import-type element in the XML file:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>&lt;import-type&gt;create-same-db&lt;/import-type&gt;</strong> - 
  This means that when doing an import, all issues being imported will be 
  considered new issues, any pre-existing data will be ignored and all data
  in the XML file will be imported as new data. Right now, this has the same
  behavior as create-different-db.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&lt;import-type&gt;create-different-db&lt;/import-type&gt;</strong> - 
  This means that when doing an import, all issues being imported will be 
  considered new issues, any pre-existing data will be ignored and all data
  in the XML file will be imported as new data. Right now, this has the same
  behavior as create-same-db.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&lt;import-type&gt;update-same-db&lt;/import-type&gt;</strong> - 
  This means that the system will try to find existing data in the database
  (such as an ActivitySet id) and will overwrite the pre-existing data
  with what is in the XML file. If it can't find the data, it will create
  new data.
</p>

<p>
The current pre-requirements for a successful import are that all of the
modules, usernames, issue/artifact types, attributes, attribute options
referenced in the XML file must already exist in the system. If they cannot
be found, the import will fail.
</p>

<p>
Importing can be done via the UI into a running scarab or via an ImportIssues 
ant task.
</p>  

<p>
The import issues screen can be found under <strong>Admin->Modules</strong>
in the navigation bar.  The import issues UI can be asked to give back the 
issue import results as xml by setting the value of the form input 'format' 
field to 'xml'.  Such a feature might be used scripting a mass import of 
issues via HTTP POST.
</p>

<p>
To perform the import via ant, one needs to setup some properties
and then execute the scarab/build/import.xml file. The properties can be
defined in a ~/build.properties file (or ~/scarab.build.properties,
scarab/build.properties, etc. Look at the top of the import.xml file
for the various locations which can be used.)
</p>

<p>
The important properties to define are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>scarab.import.issues.xml</strong> - The relative or absolute
    path to the file which is going to be used to import the issues.
    Default: ../src/dtd/scarab-issues-export.xml</li>
    <li><strong>scarab.import.config.file</strong> - The path to the xml
    import configuration file which defines the log4j settings and other 
    variables. Default: /WEB-INF/conf/xmlimport.properties</li>
    <li><strong>scarab.import.trprops.file</strong> - The path to the 
    TurbineResources.properties file which defines things like the connection
    to the database. Default: /WEB-INF/conf/TurbineResources.properties</li>
</ul>

<p>
The best thing to do in the early stages of this development phase is
to cd into the build directory and first make sure that Scarab is built (type: <strong>ant</strong>). 
Then, type the following: <strong>ant -f import.xml</strong>
</p>

<p>
You should then see the debugging output sent to the screen. If you see an 
exception, please make sure to

so that I can look into fixing it.

<p>Hi, my name is Jon Stevens. I'm the primary leader for the Scarab project. I 
    currently work on many different OS projects: <a href="http://java.apache.org/">Java 
    Apache</a>, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta</a> and <a href="http://www.working-dogs.com/">Working-Dogs.com</a>. 
    I'm pretty much involved in one way or another with all of the sub projects 
    within these projects, including Turbine, Apache JServ, ECS, Village, Town, 
    Jyve, etc.. 
<p>A few years ago I saw the complete lack of a decent bug tracking system as something 
    that would be extremely popular on the web. Thus, I have been working for the 
    last couple years building these projects up to become the infrastructure for 
    this very project. It gives me great pleasure to finally be able to work on 
    my end goal. ;-) 
<p>I also work for <a href="http://www.collab.net/">Collab.Net</a> who is sponsoring 
    my time to work on this project during work hours. Collab.Net is doing some 
    of the most interesting stuff in OS these days...essentially tying a valid and 
    solid business model around Open Source development.This is being done through 
    our <a href="http://www.sourcexchange.com/">SourceXchange</a> and <a href="http://tigris.org/">Tigris.org</a> 
    websites. I have to give the <a href="http://www.collab.net/jobs/">"we need 
    talented people"</a> plug because I want to help find more talented people to 
    work here with us on these cool projects...

<p>Hi, all. My desire to find/create a more flexible alternative to Bugzilla led 
    me to this project. While I am by no means an expert on the subject, Bugzilla 
    seems to have the conceptual issues of bug-tracking defined quite well (e.g., 
    the lifecycle of a bug). However, it's not written in my language of choice 
    and is not IMO amenable to large-scale modifications. 
<p>I am currently leading the development of a <a href="http://java.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a>-based 
    application at my company, and I need Scarab ASAP. Therefore, spending company 
    time on Scarab development is no problem. While I intend to leave the issues 
    of code design to those here who have far more experience in this domain, I 
    am more than willing to help with the implementation of said design and any 
    other coding required to get this project rolling.

<p>Hi my name is Dave Bryson and I'm addicted to free software. I'm currently a 
    contributing developer on the Turbine project. 
<p>For the past couple of weeks I've been looking for another OSS project to get 
    involved with (I've been bitten by the bug). I was hoping to find one that uses 
    Turbine/WebMacro - so this fits the bill nicely. 
<p>I don't currently have a direct need for Scarab, nor have I worked on a bug tracking 
    system; which is really why I'm interested in this (new scenery). But I do have 
    experience with Turbine, WebMacro, and Databases - both at work and on my own. 
<p>I'm very interested in rolling-up my sleeves and doing some coding. However, 
    it'll probably be a few weeks till I can really get heavily involved. Mainly 
    because I want to finish up some things on the Turbine project that might be 
    helpful on Scarab - namely the scheduler, global cache, and webmacro service. 
<p>Oh...and yes, I do this OSS stuff completely on my spare time. But I do blame 
    the ASF for only getting 4 hours of sleep some nights!

<p>Greetings - 
<p>My name is Josh Lucas.&nbsp; I found Scarab through Jon's email sig on the Turbine 
    list.&nbsp; I'm in the process of building various internal applications using 
    Turbine and Jetspeed.&nbsp; I'm doing this to show the greatness and reliability 
    of Open Source to my various superiors.&nbsp; I believe that Scarab would be 
    an additional project that could reap great benefits within my company. 
<p>I definitely want to help with code and design as much as possible.&nbsp; Since 
    I have been personally tasked to find a bug tracking utility, I can help develop 
    Scarab during the work week as well as at night and on the weekends. 
<p>I look forward to working on this project.

<p>Hello -- 
<p>My name is Craig Pfeifer and I'm interested in helping out with the scarab project. 
    I recently became interested in bug tracking when my current company switched 
    from a home grown tracking system (which we all loved dearly) to the bug tracking 
    system which is built into Siebel. 
<p>I've wanted to contribute to a OSS project for a while, but I haven't had the 
    time until recently. I'm very interested in getting my hands dirty with some 
    servlet/db code &amp; expanding my implementation/design experience with tips 
    and patterns from other developers. I've got 1 year of db schema design experience 
    and approximately 2 years of experience developing applications in java. This 
    summer I received my Java Programmer certification from Sun (FWIW), and I'm 
    about 1/2way through the development project for the Java Developer certification. 
<p>Cheers,

<h3>Below are some notes for doing development with Scarab.</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, we use the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/guidelines.html">general project
guidelines from the Jakarta project</a>, and the <a

standards from the Turbine project</a>.</p>

<h3>Change log messages</h3>

<p>Concise and descriptive change log messages are a major factor in
eking the most value out of your <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/">version control</a>/<a
href="http://scm.tigris.org/">software configuration managment</a>
tools.</p>

<p>Change log messsages are sometimes referred to as "commit logs",
"commit log messages", or just "log messages".  These phrases will be
used interchangeably throughout the docs.</p>

<p>Guidelines for writing change log messages are essentially as laid
out in the "Writing log messages" section of the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> project's <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</a>
file.</p>

<p>It's encouraged that developers start their log messages as early
in the change process as possible.  Recording a brief, high level
change summary before actually making the change, and/or recording the
change as it's made are excellent technique for producing accurate and
valuable log messages which truly aid in change tracking.  When using
a CVS/SVN style VC/SCM tool, diffing the list of files you plan on
checking in and comparing the actual changes to what's in your log
message is a great way to verify the accuracy of your log message, or
produce a change log message after the fact.</p>


<h3>Misc. development comments</h3>

<p>
As Scarab uses a build -&gt; compile -&gt; run development framework,
please remember to always edit only the files in the src directory,
and not the build target directory.
</p>

<p>
Once you have edited a file in the src directory, you need to make sure to 
execute the ant script again. If you edit a .java source file, then you 
should execute [./ant compile]. If you edit any other file, then you 
only need to execute [./ant].
</p>

<p>
If, you make a change to a source file and you don't see that change 
reflected in what you are doing, make sure to read the note above. :-)
</p>

<p>
If you delete a src/java or src/template file you will need to delete the 
corresponding src files as well as any .class files from within the target tree 
and then re-compile. For example:
</p>

<p>
Delete:<br/>
scarab/src/java/org/tigris/scarab/screens/Foo.java<br/>
Also Delete:<br/>
scarab/target/webapps/scarab/WEB-INF/src/java/org/tigris/scarab/screens/Foo.java<br/>
scarab/target/webapps/scarab/WEB-INF/classes/org/tigris/scarab/screens/Foo.class
</p>

<p>
You can make the above procedure easier by simply removing the entire target 
tree and re-creating it. Next, you are going to ask why the source file is 
stored in the WEB-INF directory. The reason is because Ant allows us to do 
String replacement in the source files. So, at some point in the future, we 
will probably use this functionality to include a version number into one 
of the source files so that it is possible to see what version of Scarab 
is running. There are other reasons for doing this as well, but this is 
an easy example to explain. :-)
</p>

<p>
At any point, you should be able to build a fresh target tree. This means 
that you should be able to kill Tomcat, remove the target directory and 
re-execute the build.sh script.
</p>

<p>
If you make a change to a .java file and then recompile, you need to wait at 
least 3 seconds (this is configurable in Tomcat's server.xml file near the 
bottom) for the classloader to notice that the class has changed and
reload it. Currently, if you are logged in, it will probably log you back out
when this happens. We are working to resolve the issue.

<p>
To use Jikes as your compiler, add the following to your ~/build.properties 
file: build.compiler=jikes
</p>

<p>
"business logic should not be coded into actions".  In the best
circumstance, actions would do nothing more than assemble objects based
on the available input data and pass them to the appropriate business
classes to carry out the requested action.
</p>

<hr noshade="true" size="1"/>

<p>
Data which resides in the logged-in user's temp Hashtable should be
keyed by a constant of the ScarabConstants interface, and have its
name prefixed with "scarab.".
</p>

<p>For example:

<pre>
YourAction.java:
List issueIdList = (List) user.getTemp("issueIdList");

                        |
                        v

ScarabConstants.java:
public static final String ISSUE_ID_LIST = "scarab.issueIdList";

YourAction.java:
List issueIdList = (List) user.getTemp(ScarabConstants.ISSUE_ID_LIST);
</pre></p>

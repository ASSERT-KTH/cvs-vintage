<p>
These are the rules for when one should add an entry to the changelog as
we as the format for adding the entry:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
One should add an entry when a bug is closed and the chances are that
the bug is not going to be re-opened.
</li>
<li>
One should add an entry when a fix is checked in that is anything other
than a nomenclature fix.
</li>
<li>
The entry should be a brief description of what was fixed. The entry
should be complete enough so that someone who does not follow
development closely can understand the change.
</li>
<li>
If the fix is for an issue, the issue id url should be linked into
the change log entry. The format example is: "Bug report: #456, 543". The
individual numbers should be html anchor element links.
</li>
<li>
At the end of the bug report entry, credit should be given to the person
who committed the fix. The format example is: "(JSS)"
</li>
</ul>

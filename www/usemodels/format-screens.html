        <li> The goal of describing screens is to prompt and guide careful 
             thought about how they system will be used and how it should be built.
        <li> In writing or reviewing screens it is very common for questions or 
             comments to come up, they can be noted here so the same thoughts 
             will be prompted again.
        <li> Serious issues should also be entered into an issue tracking system
             and/or trigger the review of associated requirements.
        <li> Also, note any properties of the screen that are relevant, but not called-out in the form.

      Notes on final screen visual layout, or links to wireframes or
      mockups.  If there are existing screens in a previous version of
      the system, or screens in some reference or competitive product,
      you can refer to them at first.  This is last because it is to
      be done once the other aspects of each screen are thought
      through.

<h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Keep widgets abstract, dont choose concrete widgets too soon.
    <li> First content, then layout, then iterate.
    <li> Compare abstract widget list to use case step details.
    <li> Compare entrances and exits to use case step sequences.
    <li> Consider screen complexity
    <li> Consider how screens scale to large datasets
    <li> Consider information update rate if applicable
    <li> Consider permissions as conditions on content item display
    <li> Consider on-screen and on-line help
    <li> This format is inspired by the <a href="http://www.forUse.com/">Usage-Centered Design</a> method.

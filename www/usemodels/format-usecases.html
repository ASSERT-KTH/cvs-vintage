    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Purpose:</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
       A few sentences to sum it up.  Try to use words that you might want to search for.

    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
      Links to the project feature list.

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Direct Actors:</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
       A list of "actor-id : user-class (priority, frequency)" one per line.<br>
       actor-id is a label that will be used to identify these actors in the steps.<br>
       user-class is the kind of user or system that they are. 
       User classes are listed and described in a separate document.<br>
       priority is how imporant this use case is to this user, 
       not all users will put emphasis on the same use cases.<br>
       frequencey is how often the user works through this use case.<br>
       "Direct actors" are basically the people at the keyboard and the systems they use.  
       Often if there is just one, we can name it "User". 
       There can be several direct actors in use cases where people collaborate closely or 
       where one person needs to use several systems to get the task done.<br>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Stakeholders:</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
      A list of "User-class: description of involvment".<br>
      Stakeholders are other people who care about how the system are used, 
      but are not actually sitting at the keyboard during this use case.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Pre-conditions:</b></td>

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Post-conditions:</b></td> 
    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
      Short sentence or two about the situtation after the use case has been done.

    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
        If there is something to say about the data entered or seen in
        the steps of the use case, it can be specified here to avoid
        cluttering the descriptions of the steps.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" COLSPAN="2" valign="top"><b>Main Success Scenario:</b><br>
      <ol>
        <li> Steps leading to the successful completion of the use case
        <li> Each takes the form "[label] actor-id: short pharase in active voice"
        <li> frequently, steps will alternate between user intention and system reaction, 
             but obvious system reactions can be skipped, and detail system 
             reactions can be shown as multiple steps.
        <li> If actions refer to interaction contexts (pages or screens), 
             they should be linked to descripttions of those.
        <li> Conditionals are written "If condition:" and then indented bullets list alternatives.
        <li> Very short conditions and actions can be written on one line.
        <li> Sometimes a step can have unordered bullets under it to 
             list small substeps where order is not important or determined.  For example when filling 
             in a form, you might bullet-list the fields requred for this use case. 
        <li> Labels are written: "[label-name]" and can be applied to any step.  
             Even though steps are numbered, the numbers can change and shold not be used for reference.
        <li> Loops are written as "While Condition:" and then indented steps.
        <li> User progress through the Main Success Scenario should be fairly straight-line.  
             If you find you are writing a lot of conditionals, you probably need to 
             break up the use case into more specific ones, or list alternatives in the next section.
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" COLSPAN="2" valign="top"><b>Alternative Scenario Extensions:</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li> Each item here should make reference to one of the labeled steps above 
             and provide an alternative or optional additional step.
        <li> One of the biggest uses for this is specifying error conditions.
        <li> For example: "[validation] if validation fails, Scarab displays InvalidIssueNumber page"
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" COLSPAN="2" valign="top"><b>Notes/Questions:</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li> The goal of writing use cases is to prompt and guide careful 
             thought about how they system will be used and how it should be built.
        <li> In writing or reviewing use cases it is very common for questions or 
             comments to come up, they can be noted here s the same thoughts 
             will be prompted again.
        <li> Serious issues should also be entered into an issue tracking system
             and/or trigger the review of associated requirements.

<h3>Short form</h3>

(anchor for html link to unique-id goes here)
<a name="UNIQUE-ID"></a>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" bgcolor="#cccccc">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Name:</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">UNIQUE-ID: Short descriptive phrase</td>

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="white" align="right" valign="top"><b>Purpose:</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="white" valign="top">
       A few sentences to sum it up.  Try to use words that you might
       want to search for.  You can also include other sections if
       they are key to the use case.  The point is to get all required
       use cases into some document at some level of specificity, so
       that they are not lost and so that the level of completeness of
       the overall requirements specification can be measured.

<h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Consider interaction between tigris roles and user classes
    <li> Consider interaction between tigris user classes and type of site
    <li> Consider interaction between user classes and permissions
    <li> Consider the knowledge that users have at the start and at each step
    <li> For each prerequiste fact, is there any way the use case could changed to eliminate or delay the need for that assumption?
    <li> This format is inspired by the <a href="http://www.forUse.com/">Usage-Centered Design</a> method.

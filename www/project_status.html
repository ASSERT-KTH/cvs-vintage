<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Project Start Date: 8/2<br/>
Project Finish Date: 10/11 
</p>

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com">Runbox</a> where
you can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This
is a nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any
data in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it is
not responding the machine may have crashed, it has been a bit unstable
as of late...not related to Scarab, try back again later.
</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>Overall:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IA/UI has been started.</li>
    <li><a href="integration.html">Integration issues</a> have been
    started and nearly completed.</li>
    <li>Module code has been abstracted out using a Factory and Services
    pattern so that it is possible to <a
    href="integration.html">integrate</a> Scarab into other
    systems.</li>
    <li>
    Implementation of Screens has been started (with many completed).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Specific:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Login/Registration has been completed.</li>
    <li>Enter an issue has been completed.</li>
    <li>View an issue has been completed.</li>
    <li>Query for an existing issue is almost completed.</li>
    <li>Attribute editor is almost completed.</li>
    <li>Integration of Flux has been completed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    6-22-01 - People are still coding, however the M1 milestone has been
    pushed back another 5 days until 6-29 because Jon is out of town for
    6-25-6-26 and I think that we won't make 6-25 for M1. Some of the
    delay is a result of John being out sick for a week and Jon trying
    to help figure out some show stopping bugs in Catalina's classloader
    implementation that causes Scarab to not function when classes are
    reloaded. These were both unanticpated delays.
</li>
<li>
    7-02-01 - Elicia is almost finished with IssueView. John is mostly
    done with IssueEntry. I (Jon) am still behind on AttributeEditor.
    However, I have made progress on creating a <a
    href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where people can see
    Scarab running on a test server. Each night, Scarab and Turbine are
    checked out from CVS, built clean and Catalina is restarted. We are
    still waiting on M2 UI's from Briano.
</li>
<li>
    7-10-01 - After some discussion, John is going back and making it so
    that multiple Attribute values can be defined. This will require
    creating another table and modifying a bunch of code. This is
    necessary because it will provide us with a better schema design in
    the long run. Previously, we were going to just store this
    information in a text column, but that isn't a good long standing
    design. Elicia is going to pick up the IssueQuery changes. Jon is
    working on upgrading Scarab to work with Turbine 2.2 as well as
    trying to resolve some classloader issues with Tomcat. The UI team
    is working on updating the UI with a better stylesheet and finishing
    up the rest of the milestone deliverables.
</li>
<li>
    8-16-01 - It has been a while for an update...we have been busy.
    John and Elicia are cranking on doing screens (see the new project
    milestone schedule to see what people are working on). We now have a
    project milestone schedule thanks to Neal. Jon is ever working on
    the attribute editor but keeps getting side tracked with underlying
    framework level and code cleanup issues. There are several 
    <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?searchText=TODO&listName=dev&defaultField=subject">TODO</a>
    items that have been posted to the mailing list that we are looking
    for someone to own.

</ul>

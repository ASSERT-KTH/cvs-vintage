<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Project 1.0 Alpha 1 Release Date: 10/15
</p>

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
Note: the finish date says 12/3. Thanks to the magic of M$ Project, this
isn't accurate. We are shooting for a decently usable system around the
middle of October.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    9-19-01 - Everyone is still coding like mad in order to reach our
    Alpha 1 date. We would also like to welcome a new (non-CollabNet)
    developer to the project, Tim McNerney. He is currently working on
    improving the testing suites. There also seems to be an influx of
    people registering for Observer roles (1-4/day!) on the Scarab
    project as well as people looking at the Runbox. Welcome! If you are
    inclined, please going our development mailing list and send us an
    intro or some comments.

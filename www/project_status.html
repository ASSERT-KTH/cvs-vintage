heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.

<p>
There is a Runbox (available again soon) where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    02-03-2003 - It has been way to long since an update. We have been
    really really really busy at work and Scarab has come a long way since
    the last release. Believe me, this project is still very active and
    becoming more active every day. CollabNet has allocated more development
    resources to Scarab and there are more people using it all the time. Until
    the next release happens, we suggest that you pull a nightly tarball or
    CVS head. We are currently working towards stability and you should expect
    that any nightly snapshot should work quite well and be easily upgraded.
    See the <a href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    10-18-2002 - Release early, release often. See the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    09-27-2002 - Release early, release often. See the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    09-07-2002 - The fix in b10 (see below) never actually made it so we
    are doing another release to fix that as well as a bunch of other
    issues that had come up. Release early, release often. See the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    08-28-2002 - Found a nasty bug introduced in b9 and fixed it as well
    as making a couple other changes. This warrented a b10 release so 
    here it is. See the <a href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    08-26-2002 - After way too long of a wait, Scarab 1.0-b9 has been
    released. We have added a major new feature which is cross
    module/issue type searching as well as an interface/factory for 
    the basis of <a href="workflow.html">workflow<a/> to be implemented by
    the community. We also fixed quite a few bugs and made the code much
    more stable. See the <a href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    07-10-2002 - Scarab is now <a href="/issues.html">self hosting</a>.
    This is a fairly major milestone because we are now using Scarab to 
    track bugs in Scarab. We are also now finding all sorts of bugs that
    we are quickly fixing. Expect the next beta (sometime in the next
    month) to be really great!
</li>
<li>
    06-14-2002 - 1.0b8 has more bug fixes and feature additions...see the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    05-07-2002 - 1.0b7 has more bug fixes and feature additions...see the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details. Even as a beta
    quality product, Scarab seems very popular. We continue to get
    50-200 downloads/day. We keep working hard on it and it just
    keeps getting better and better.
</li>
<li>
    04-04-2002 - 1.0b6 has more bug fixes and feature additions...see the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    03-19-2002 - After a slight delay from some last minute bug reports,
    we have released b5. This release has all known major 'show
    stopping' issues fixed and includes a number of major enhancements
    and changes. As usual, please see the <a
    href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details. As a trial, Scarab is
    also now the default bug database for the Jakarta Turbine projects.
    This should help us quickly do additional testing for Scarab.
</li>
<li>
    03-16-2002 - We have been working hard and have made a ton of
    fixes and changes to Scarab since beta 4, so now beta 5 will be 
    released on the 19th. Scarab is really starting to look good now.
</li>
<li>
    03-06-2002 - Beta 5 has been delayed until we are more confident
    that Scarab will run in MySQL and Postgres. The reason why is that
    the porting to Postgres effort revealed several places where we
    either had bugs in Scarab or bad dependencies on MySQL. This also
    gives us a chance to improve the database creation scripts and the
    documentation surrounding that process. We are also fixing several
    bugs that have been reported in Scarab as well as working on the XML
    import/export (which has been hampered by bugs in Bugzilla).
    <strong>Please note that b4 has several bugs in it as well that
    prevent people from entering new issues to new Modules. This has
    been fixed in CVS so please use a nightly snapshot.</strong>
</li>
<li>
    02-19-2002 - <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">Beta 4 has been released</a>! 
    Quite a lot of improvements to the application made it into this
    release. John did a lot of work on adding object caching through the
    application in order to reduce duplicate object creation and queries
    to the database. This had a HUGE impact on the speed of the
    application. We will continue to work on performance, but this was a
    big short term win for us. Jon did various bug fixes as well as
    started work towards a bit more database independence in the build
    system which will make it easier for people using databases other
    than MySQL. Elicia and others continued their bug fixing and
    application improvements. All in all, Scarab is really coming
    together now. Please see the <a href="changes.html">changelog</a>
    for the rest of the details.
</li>
<li>
    02-11-2002 - <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">Beta 3 has been released</a>! 
    Please see the <a href="changes.html">changelog</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
    02-04-2002 - We made a number of <a href="changes.html">fixes and
    improvements</a> and have <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">
    released Beta 2</a> today. Yea! Congrats to everyone who is helping
    with Scarab. The next release date will be a week from now on
    2-11-2002. We hope to continue releasing beta's for a bit and do not
    have a timeframe on a final 1.0 quite yet. We promise to let you
    know when we know.
</li>
<li>
    01-31-2002 - Over 170 downloads of Scarab 1.0b1 were recorded the
    first day it was released! We have been receiving excellent bug
    reports and have been working hard to <a href="changes.html">close
    issues</a> as quickly as possible. In appreciation of the open
    source principles of 'release early, release often'; the next
    release date (1.0b2) will be 02-04-2002.
</li>
<li>
    01-28-2002 - <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">Beta 1
    release</a>!! We are missing some functionality and have some bugs
    and are now using <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issuezilla</a
    > to track things todo. So, if you find something interesting that
    you would like to work on there, please add a comment or assign the
    issue to yourself.

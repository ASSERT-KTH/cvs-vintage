<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Beta 1 Release Date: 12-28-2002
</p>

<!--
<p>
* "dr" stands for Developer Release which means that it is still under
heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.
</p>
-->

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
We are shooting for a decently usable system around the middle/end of
December.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.

<ul>
<li>
    01-08-2002 - Beta 1 release date is set at 12-28-02. We are
    missing some functionality and have some bugs and are now using <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issuezilla</a
    > to track things todo. So, if you find something interesting that
    you would like to work on there, please add a comment or assign the
    issue to yourself.

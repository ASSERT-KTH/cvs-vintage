<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>Overall:</p>

    <li>IA/UI has been started.</li>
    <li><a href="integration.html">Integration issues</a> have been
    started and nearly completed.</li>
    <li>Module code has been abstracted out using a Factory and Services

    href="integration.html">integrate</a> Scarab into other
    systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Login/Registration has been implemented.</li>
    <li>Enter an issue has been started.</li>
    <li>View an issue has been started.</li>

    <li>Integration of Flux has been started.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The Scarab project is currently under development. It has been under
development for quite some time now, however the development hasn't been
100% on Scarab, it has been on the underlying framework technologies
that we are using to develop Scarab. The reason is that we have wanted
to solve some of the MVC design issues (<a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/pullmodel.html">Pull Model</a>
and <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/services/intake-service.html">Intake</a>)
before trying to create the application. This development has gone on in
the Turbine and Velocity projects on <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">jakarta.apache.org</a>
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    6-22-01 - People are still coding, however the M1 milestone has been
    pushed back another 5 days until 6-29 because Jon is out of town for
    6-25-6-26 and I think that we won't make 6-25 for M1. Some of the
    delay is a result of John being out sick for a week and Jon trying
    to help figure out some show stopping bugs in Catalina's classloader
    implementation that causes Scarab to not function when classes are
    reloaded. These were both unanticpated delays.
</li>
<li>
    7-02-01 - Elicia is almost finished with IssueView. John is mostly
    done with IssueEntry. I (Jon) am still behind on AttributeEditor.
    However, I have made progress on creating a <a
    href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where people can see
    Scarab running on a test server. Each night, Scarab and Turbine are
    checked out from CVS, built clean and Catalina is restarted. We are
    still waiting on M2 UI's from Briano.
</li>
<li>
    7-10-01 - After some discussion, John is going back and making it so
    that multiple Attribute values can be defined. This will require
    creating another table and modifying a bunch of code. This is
    necessary because it will provide us with a better schema design in
    the long run. Previously, we were going to just store this
    information in a text column, but that isn't a good long standing
    design. Elicia is going to pick up the IssueQuery changes. Jon is
    working on upgrading Scarab to work with Turbine 2.2 as well as
    trying to resolve some classloader issues with Tomcat. The UI team
    is working on updating the UI with a better stylesheet and finishing
    up the rest of the milestone deliverables.

* "dr" stands for Developer Release which means that it is still under
heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.

We are shooting for a decently usable system around the middle/end of

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.

    have a timeframe on a final 1.0 quite yet. We promise to let you
    know when we know.

    01-31-2002 - Over 170 downloads of Scarab 1.0b1 were recorded the
    first day it was released! We have been receiving excellent bug
    reports and have been working hard to <a href="changes.html">close
    issues</a> as quickly as possible. In appreciation of the open
    source principles of 'release early, release often'; the next
    release date (1.0b2) will be 02-04-2002.

    01-28-2002 - <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">Beta 1

    and are now using <a
    href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issuezilla</a
    > to track things todo. So, if you find something interesting that
    you would like to work on there, please add a comment or assign the

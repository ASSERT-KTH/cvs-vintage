<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The Scarab project is currently under development. It has been under
development for quite some time now, however the development hasn't been
100% on Scarab, it has been on the underlying framework technologies
that we are using to develop Scarab. The reason is that we have wanted
to solve some of the MVC design issues before trying to create the
application. This development has gone on in the Turbine and Velocity
projects on <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">jakarta.apache.org</a>
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    We are now in the process of focusing our attention <a
    href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">IA/UI development</a> as well
    as continuing some initial application development. We have also
    started a <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">"ui_docs"
    mailing list</a> to discuss this development.
</li>
<li>
    John has <a href="/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=5">started</a> working on
    integration of Flux which is a web application that allows for the
    modification of users/roles/permissions/groups within the Scarab
    system. This is important for standalone use as well as for testing
    integrated use.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<ul>
    <li>IA/UI has been started.</li>
    <li><a href="integration.html">Integration issues</a> have been

    <li>Login/Registration has been implemented.</li>
    <li>Enter an issue has been started.</li>
    <li>Show an issue has been started.</li>
    <li>Query for an existing issue has been started.</li>
    <li>Attribute editor has been started.</li>
    <li>Integration of Flux has been started.</li>
    <li>Module code has been abstracted out using a Factory and Services

    systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The Scarab project is currently under development. It has been under
development for quite some time now, however the development hasn't been
100% on Scarab, it has been on the underlying framework technologies
that we are using to develop Scarab. The reason is that we have wanted
to solve some of the MVC design issues (<a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/pullmodel.html">Pull Model</a>
and <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/services/intake-service.html">Intake</a>)
before trying to create the application. This development has gone on in
the Turbine and Velocity projects on <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">jakarta.apache.org</a>
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    We are now in the process of focusing our attention <a
    href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">IA/UI development</a> as well
    as continuing some initial application development. We have also
    started a <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">"ui_docs"
    mailing list</a> to discuss this development.
</li>
<li>
    5-21-01 - Jon S. pretty much finished up the abstraction of the
    Module code so that any implementation can be provided of a Module
    and Scarab will just use that.
</li>
<li>
    5-29-01 - Jon met with Elicia and BrianO and went over preliminary
    UI screens. BrianO will isolate which screens make it into Milestone
    1 and then over the next few days, Elicia will be working to convert
    those screens into Turbine Screen modules and get them checked into
    CVS so that we can start to make them functional.
</li>
<li>
    5-29-01 - John is working on assigning an issue to a user and the 
    permission system integration.
</li>
<li>
    6-07-01 - Javaone has been taking up a bunch of time. Recieved
    initial UI mockups.
</li>
<li>
    6-10-01 - Added tentative dates to milestones. Community involvement
    may help lower the timeframes. (hint hint). Working on initial
    integration of Milestone 1 UI mockups.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Scarab 1.0dr1* Release Date: 10/17
</p>

<p>
* "dr" stands for Developer Release which means that it is still under
heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.
</p>

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
Note: the finish date says 12/3. Thanks to the magic of M$ Project, this
isn't accurate. We are shooting for a decently usable system around the
middle of November.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.

<ul>
<li>
    10-15-01 - We are going to be behind on the 1.0dr1 release a day or
    so...we gave it out best shot to make it on Monday, but reality is
    that adding the artifact type stuff has taken a bit longer to get
    implemented than we estimated...not only has it meant some fairly
    large changes to the database and code, but we also have to provide
    about 5-6 screens worth of admin editors on some fairly complex
    business logic. I just don't want to release with this stuff being
    not completely implemented and the logic not fully tested.

<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Scarab 1.0dr1* Release Date: 10/24
</p>

<p>
* "dr" stands for Developer Release which means that it is still under
heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.
</p>

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
Note: the finish date says 12/3. Thanks to the magic of M$ Project, this
isn't accurate. We are shooting for a decently usable system around the
middle of November.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    10-19-01 - Still in heavy development mode. We are about a week
    behind because we added artifact types. It is a fairly major change
    to the system and has set us back a bit. The good news is that it is
    coming along quite well and things are starting to stabalize. The
    ability to create an number of artifact types / module and have each
    artifact type have its own set of attributes is a very cool feature.
    I figure that if we delay the 1.0dr1 release until next week, we
    will be in much better shape than to release a product we know isn't
    ready for release yet.

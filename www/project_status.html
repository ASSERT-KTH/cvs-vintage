<p>
The Scarab project is currently under development. It has been under
development for quite some time now, however the development hasn't been
100% on Scarab, it has been on the underlying framework technologies
that we are using to develop Scarab. The reason is that we have wanted
to solve some of the MVC design issues before trying to create the
application. This development has gone on in the Turbine and Velocity
projects on <a href="http://Jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta.apache.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Development work on Scarab that can be considered nearly complete is the
overall design of the database as well as the sandbox that has been
created to allow people to easily check Scarab out of CVS, build it and
run the included Tomcat servlet engine. We have also completed the
login/registration screens as well as started work on the attribute
editor and the first few issue related screens (entering a bug and
viewing a bug). Part of this development work is the validation of the
underlying framework code that we have developed.
</p>

<p>
We are now in the process of focusing our attention IA/UI issues as well
as continuing some initial application development. Because things
change quickly and we may not have time to always update this document,
it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most up to date
reflection of the current project status.

<p>
We are always looking for volunteers to help with the development of
Scarab. Below are some of the things on our TODO list which we feel that 
people may want to contribute to.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a Bugzilla -> Scarab database migration tool (volunteers
    needed!).</li>
</ul>

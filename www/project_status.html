<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Project 1.0 Alpha 1 Release Date: 10/15
</p>

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
Note: the finish date says 12/3. Thanks to the magic of M$ Project, this
isn't accurate. We are shooting for a decently usable system around the
middle of October.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.

    10-8-01 - Brain dump: Still coding like mad. A proposal has gone out
    regarding Artifact Types. We are going to try to make this into the
    alpha release. Got the i18n stuff in place and tested. John and
    Elicia are working on templates. Still need to work through the code
    and fix a lot of the FIXME's. Need to come up with a scheme for
    dealing with tracking post data after login as well as come up with
    a chain of screen tracking. Susan is working on updating the UI's to
    the latest CSS. Other than that, we are looking pretty good.

<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Scarab 1.0dr1* Release Date: 10/15
</p>

<p>
* "dr" stands for Developer Release which means that it is still under
heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.
</p>

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
Note: the finish date says 12/3. Thanks to the magic of M$ Project, this
isn't accurate. We are shooting for a decently usable system around the
middle of October.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.

<li>
    10-13-01 - A lot of work on the UI front end has been made and the
    app looks better than ever. We have also put a bunch of effort into
    getting the concept of Artifact Types into the first release.
    Reports are almost done as well. We have documented the <a
    href="duplicate.html">duplicate checking</a> process. Monday Oct
    15th is looming.

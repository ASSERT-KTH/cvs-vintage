<h3><i>Tentative</i> Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Release Date: ?
</p>

<!--
<p>
* "dr" stands for Developer Release which means that it is still under
heavy development and is not considered ready for use on live servers.
We expect to have weekly dr releases until we get to either alpha or
beta releases.
</p>
-->

<p>
<a href="project_schedule.html">Project Milestones</a>, who is assigned
to what and their dates of completion are now tracked on another page.
We are shooting for a decently usable system around the middle/end of
December.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">Runbox</a> where you
can look at an actual instance of Scarab running on a machine. This is a
nightly build and run of the latest version of Scarab from CVS. Any data
in the database will get replaced the next rebuild. Note: If it shows an
error is not responding, it is probably due to a bad nightly build and
will be corrected within the next 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Recent Activities</h3>

<p>
Because things change quickly and we may not have time to always update
this document, it is best to consider the mailing list archives the most
up to date reflection of the current project status.

    12-6-01 - Thanks to the excellent work of the guys at Bitonic we now
    have the ability to transform a Bugzilla XML file into a Scarab XML
    file and can then import that into the Scarab database. This is a
    huge milestone for us. We have all been working on tidying up lose
    ends and making sure that the flow of the application is
    appropriate. We are also focusing on making the UI easier to use in
    areas that we have already identified. Things are still progressing
    very well.

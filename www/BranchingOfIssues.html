Normal development takes place in <i>main-trunk</i>and <i>stabilization</i> branch is for stabilization before some release.<p><b>Problematic situations:</b><ol><li>Bug is fixed only in main-trunk because it is too risky to fix it in stabilizationbranch.</li><li>Bug is fixed only in stabilization branch because fix is needed for therelease, but for the next release more sophisticated fix will be developed.</li><li>Sustaining group wants to create patch for some release. So, they needto modify bugs for the release they are patching.</li><li>User wants to list all bugs in the release he/she have installed on his/hercomputer.</li></ol><h3><a NAME="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h3>Following requirements should be fulfilled to solve problems mentionedabove:<ul><li>Attributes of bugs can differ in different branches.</li><li>New branch can be created for some product from another branch.</li><li>Bug can be modified in given branch.</li><li>Bug can be modified in several branches at once.</li><li>Bug can be entered into given branch.</li><li>Bug can be entered into several branches at once.</li><li>New branch of bug can be created.</li><li>User can find bugs in specified branch.</li></ul><b>Attributes of bugs can differ in different branches.</b><p>Bugs can have different status and comments in different branches. Lookat the situations one and two from the case study. For example in the secondsituation the bug will be marked as FIXED in the stabilization branch andleft as ASSIGNED or even NEW in the main-trunk where also comment aboutnecessary changes will be added.<p><b>New branch can be created for some product from another branch.</b><p>When new branch is created in CVS repository it is sometimes a goodidea to branch bugs according to the CVS branch. For example in the casestudy we are interested not only in bugs that are in stabilization branch(these bugs will be in the upcoming release) but also in the main-trunk(these bugs will be in next releases).<p><b>Bug can be modified in given branch.</b><p>This requirement is connected with the first requirement. The user shouldhave possibility to see and modify attributes in the branch he/she is interested.He/she should be able to switch from one branch of the bug to another easily.<p><b>Bug can be modified in several branches at once.</b><p>The most common situation in the case study is that the bug is fixedin both branches at once. So, there should be possibility to manipulatewith attributes in more branches at once. For example when the bug is fixedin both main-trunk and stabilization branches the developer should be ableto select both branches and change their status at once.<p><b>Bug can be entered into given branch.</b><p>When a branch exists some time it is natural that bugs that appear onlyin this branch are found.<p><b>Bug can be entered into several branches at once.</b><p>It is impossible to know about all bugs in the current build. New bugsthat appear in several branches are found quite often. Therefore it isimportant to be able to enter new bug into several branches at once. Careshould be taken of branches new bug should be entered into. In open-sourceprojects we cannot rely on a good will of the external user to try whetherthis bug appears in other branches. Some rules have to be established aboutbranches that probably contain the new bug.<p><b>New branch of bug can be created.</b><p>Sometimes can happen that bug was entered into more specific branchthat it should have been entered. In such situations it should be possibleto branch just one bug report.<p><b>User can find bugs in specified branch.</b><p>Ability to list bugs in given branch is very important for almost algroups: users, QA engineers, developers, managers etc. Users should beable to find all open bugs in their installed version. Managers are interestedin fixed bugs for particular patch etc.<h3><a NAME="UsersView"></a>User's View</h3>User's view of the bug-branching depends on the depth of its support.<p><b>Light support</b><ul><li>Branch corresponds to the Version (or maybe to the combination of few attributeslike Version and Target-milestone).</li><li>Each branch of a bug has its own bug number.</li><li>One branch of the same bug is associated with other branches through fieldlike <i>Other Branches </i>similar to <i>Depends on</i> field.</li><li>When a new branch is created for some product from a given branch, attributesof bugs in the given branch are copied into new bug reports and <i>Otherbranches</i> fields are modified to show up-to-date information. Maybeadditional rules should be specified what should happen with both branches(e.g. Target-milestone should be set to something etc.)</li><li>Bug can be modified in given branch by editing bug with Version set tospecified branch.</li><li>"Modify several branches" link is part of the page displaying attributesof bugs. This link moves user to the "Change several bugs at once" pagewith all branches of this bug shown. User can select which branches he/shewants to modify.</li><li>Bug can be entered into some branch by setting correct Version.</li><li>Attempt to enter bug into several branches means that someone have founda bug that appeared in the product before the branch was created. So, theuser have to specify only one Version (the one before branching) and thebug will be entered into all branches created from this Version. This meansthat somewhere in the Scarab have to be stored rules (maintained by administrator)that determines the branches the entered bug should belong to. Maybe additionalrules should specify how should be set some attributes (e.g. Target-milestone)in branches.</li><li>User can create new branch of some bug by duplicating existing bug report(and setting correct Version).</li><li>User can find bugs in the given branch by submitting query with Versionset to the name of the branch.</li></ul><b>Intermediate support</b><p>Some kind of compromise between the light and wide support.<p><b>Wide support</b><ul><li>All branches are under one bug number. They cannot be separated from eachother.</li><li>Attributes are divided into two categories - common for all branches (e.g.Product, Component etc.) and specific for each branch (e.g. Status, AdditionalComments, etc.)</li><li>User can switch to different branch of some bug by choosing another valuefrom the Branch (or Version) combo box.</li><li>When a new branch is created for some product from a given branch, thanin all bugs that has such branch is created new branch. Attributes in thenew branch are copied from the original branch.</li><li>Bug can be modified in given branch by editing attributes that correspondto the given branch.</li><li>Editing of more branches can be similar to the editing in the light supportmodel.</li><li>Bug can be entered into specified brach by creating new bug with only onebranch.</li><li>Creation of bug in several branches can be similar to the creation in thelight support model.</li><li>User can create new branch of some bug by duplicating attributes in theexisting branch.</li><li>User can find bugs in the given branch by submitting query with Versionset to the name of the branch.</li></ul><b>Advantages of the wide support</b><ul><li>Avoiding inconsistencies (common attributes have to be same for all branches).</li><li>Simplified changes of common attributes.</li><li>Branches of some bug are tightly connected (not held together by hacks).</li><li>All branches are stored under one bug number.</li></ul></body></html>

This document details all of the database modifications for each
'action'. In other words, if you want to create a dependency (the
action), then you would follow the steps immediately below to insert the
appropriate data into the right parts of the database schema. This
document should eventually evolve into a set of tests which can be run
to ensure that the right data gets inserted into the right places. There
are several areas in this document where there are bugs in the current
code. These areas are marked with a FIXME. While most of them are not
critical to the execution of Scarab, they are critical when it comes to
trying to export the data and re-import it back in because in some cases
data is not being saved or it is being saved in the wrong places.

This document is a work in progress and is currently incomplete, however
the parts that are currently in the document can be considered complete.

RULE #1:
    Comments (saved as Attachments) about the Activit(y/ies) are always
    added to the ActivitySet, not the Activity, regardless of the number
    of Activities in the ActivitySet.

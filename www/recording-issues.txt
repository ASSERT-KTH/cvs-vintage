This document details all of the database modifications for each
'action'. In other words, if you want to create a dependency (the
action), then you would follow the steps immediately below to insert the
appropriate data into the right parts of the database schema. This
document should eventually evolve into a set of tests which can be run
to ensure that the right data gets inserted into the right places. There
are several areas in this document where there are bugs in the current
code. These areas are marked with a FIXME. While most of them are not
critical to the execution of Scarab, they are critical when it comes to
trying to export the data and re-import it back in because in some cases
data is not being saved or it is being saved in the wrong places.

This document is a work in progress and is currently incomplete, however
the parts that are currently in the document can be considered complete.

RULE #1:
All comments, urls, and files should be added to the Activity record. 
The only attachment that should be associated with an ActivitySet is the
"reason" that ties the activities together.

            Previous Activity record with same issue_id and attribute_id has
            END_DATE set to the CREATE_DATE of this ActivitySet.  This makes
            reporting on past state of db reasonably performant.  This works
            for non-user attributes as they are all currently single valued.
            See user attributes for noted problems in multivalued attributes.

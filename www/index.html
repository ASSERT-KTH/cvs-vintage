            The goal of the Scarab project is to build an
            Issue/Artifact tracking system that has the following
            features:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A full feature set similar to those found in other Issue/Artifact tracking 
                    systems: data entry, queries, reports, notifications to interested 
                    parties, collaborative accumulation of comments, dependency 
                    tracking</li>
                <li>In addition to the standard features, Scarab has fully
                    customizable and unlimited numbers of 
                    Modules (your various projects),
                    Issue/Artifact types (Defect, Enhancement, Requirement, etc), 
                    Attributes (Operating System, Status, Priority, etc),
                    Attribute options (P1, P2, P3) which can all be defined 
                    on a per Module basis so that each of your modules is
                    configured for your specific tracking requirements.
                <li>Built using Java Servlet technology for speed, scalability, 
                    maintainability, and ease of installation.</li> 
                <li>Import/Export ability via XML allowing for easy migration
                    from other systems (like Bugzilla).</li>
                <li>Modular code design that allows manageable modifications of 
                    existing and new features over time.</li>
                <li>Fully customizable through a set of administrative pages.</li>
                <li>Easily modified UI look and feel.</li>
                <li>Can be integrated into larger systems by re-implementing
                    key interfaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Although the final product will have a strong feature set,
            many of these features will be based on support in an
            underlying library of collaboration components. For example,
            Scarab will not implement its own notification system or
            localization system, that should be a reusable component of
            the underlying <a
            href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/turbine-3/">framework</a>.
            </p>

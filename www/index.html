        <td bgcolor="#f0f0f0">The goal of the Scarab project is to build a bug tracking 
            system that has the following features: 
            <ul>
                <li> A full feature set similar to those found in other bug tracking 
                    systems: data entry, queries, reports, notifications to interested 
                    parties, collaborative accumulation of comments, dependency 
                    tracking, collaborative prioritization (bug voting). 
                <li> Built as a set of Java servlets for speed, scalability, maintainability, 
                    and ease of installation. 
                <li> Compatible with Bugzilla and other widely used bug tracking 
                    system. Possibly via a bug report DTD. 
                <li> Modular design that allows manageable integration of new features 
                    over time. 
                <li> Fully customizable through a set of administrative pages.</li>
            </ul>
            Although the final product will have a strong feature set, many of these 
            features will be based on support in an underlying library of collaboration 
            components. For example, Scarab will not implement its own notification 
            system or localization system, that should be a reusable component of 
            the underlying framework.</td>

                12/18/00 - Scarab re-designed CVS tree is in place. It should be 
                much easier to do development with Scarab now. We are using <a 
                href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant 1.2</a> as the build 
                platform and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat 
                4.0m5</a> as the container (however, any 2.0 and greater engine 
                should work). We have also started the switch to Velocity.

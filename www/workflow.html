<h2>Scarab - Workflow</h2>
<h4>$Id: workflow.html,v 1.1 2002/02/11 22:19:12 jon Exp $</h4>

<p>
This document is a bit of a FAQ document about something that Scarab
is currently sorely missing. What Scarab is missing is the concept of
workflow. This means that there is some sort of 'process' by which 
an Issue changes its attributes relating to a particular issue's state.

&gt; Scarab IS flexible in terms of attribute/permission management (Awesome
&gt; data model design!)
</p>

<p>
Thanks!
</p>

<p>
&gt; But I don't know how to manage Scarab to satisfy this use case:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Customers/partners and developers work on same module. <br />
&gt; 1. We want customers/partners to see limited fields, for example,<br />
&gt; without seeing <br />
&gt; fields like status/priority/resolution/vote etc when they enter new<br />
&gt; issues. These <br />
&gt; fields will take default values.<br />
&gt; 2. Later on, customers should be able to query/view status change on<br />
&gt; these fields.<br />
&gt; 3. Developers can always enter/view/query on all fields.<br />
</p>

<p>
This is part of what we generically refer to as 'workflow' and is not
yet implemented.
</p>

<p>
Part of the main problem with implementing 'workflow' is figuring out
how to implement it in such a way as to be easily setup and defined as
well as work with the fact that Attributes within Scarab are not static.
In other words, you can define anything as an Attribute...since that is
the case, what if a particular Issue Type does not have the attribute
"Status"?

So far, I have looked into using some of the open source workflow
packages that are available (Commons-Workflow, Jess, Drools, and a
future proposed JSR based on Jess), but the issue is that none of these
are easily used. It takes quite a bit of understanding of how everything
works in order to build a customized workflow.

<p>
In your description above, you start to describe the workflow that you
would like to see, however, it is far from complete. On top of finding a
tool to execute the workflow, we also need complete workflows from
Scarab Users. If you would like to document one that you would like to
see, that would be great.

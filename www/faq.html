<p>
<strong>Is there suitable 'propaganda' material that I could use in 
my company demo to try to convince my boss that it is a good
idea to use Scarab?</strong>
</p>

<p>
The website and use of Scarab itself are all we currently have.
Scarab is very easy to <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/source/browse/~checkout~/scarab/README.txt">install and setup</a>, 
so it should not take you much time to become comfortable with 
Scarab so that you can perform your own demonstration.
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p>
<strong>Is Scarab ready for production use?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Scarab is in pre-1.0 beta. It has been in development for over
two years now and there is quite a lot of features in it. On
July 9th, 2002, we became self hosting. This means that we now
use Scarab to track Scarab so we feel it is ready enough for
usage. We also know that there are several large corporations
using Scarab. Please note that we do not promise anything. If
Scarab eats your database, then we hope you have good backups.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What are Scarab's disadvantages over Bugzilla?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Scarab has many features and advantages over Bugzilla, which we
are not going to get into here, but the primary disadvantages are:
</p>

<p>
#1. implementation of workflow<br />
        This means that Scarab does not have any logic
        implemented within it that allows you to say things
        like: when the State is changed to closed, change the 
        resolution to resolved. There is an API for allowing
        this to happen, however, it has not been implemented
        in the Open Source version of Scarab yet. We are hoping
        that the community will implement this for us since 
        CollabNet is not making this part available at this time.
</p>

<p>
#2. testing and deployment as wide as Bugzilla<br />
        Bugzilla has been deployed far and wide over a number
        of years and has undergone a great amount of testing
        and visibility on the Mozilla.org website. Scarab has 
        not had the same level of testing and usage.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What problems might arise if I deploy Scarab now?</strong>
</p>

<p>
We have not heard of any major data integrity issues. In other words, we
have not heard of Scarab destroying its own database. However, we have
found several bugs along the way where things were not being logged
properly or other such annoyances.
</p>

<p>
We recommend strongly that you make regular backups of your database by
doing full dumps. That way, if something does go wrong, not only can you
send us a copy of your database (if appropriate) but you can also revert
to the previous state.
</p>

<p>
We provide database upgrade scripts for each revision of Scarab. That 
way you can be sure that if you start using Scarab now, you will be able
to forward migrate your data when there are Scarab updates. Please see
the upgrade instructions below for more information.
</p>

<p>
You may also run into various bugs or missing features within Scarab. It
is best to first search our <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues.html">issue database</a> and <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/source/browse/~checkout~/scarab/KNOWN_ISSUES.txt">KNOWN_ISSUES.txt</a> file to see if we know about the
issue. If not, please let us know by reporting it to the issue tracker.
Whatever you do, please don't send it to the mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
Remember, Scarab is still pre-1.0 beta software and is still under
heavy development.

<p>
<strong>What documentation is available?</strong>
</p>

<p>
There is two types of documentation for Scarab. There is <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/project_docs.html">what is available on
the website</a> (which tends towards administration and other questions) and
there is user level documentation that is built into the application itself
and is available in the left side navigation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why am I getting an error connecting to MySQL?</strong>
</p>

<p>
From the <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/source/browse/~checkout~/scarab/README.txt">README.txt</a> file:
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If you get a 'Server configuration denies access to data source'
      or 'access denied' or 'Invalid authorization' error from MySQL in
      the log files, please read the MySQL documentation on how to fix
      this error. We will not provide support for this since it is
      really a MySQL configuration issue. Here is a couple links to help
      you solve your problem:
</p>

<p>
<strong>How can I contribute to Scarab and why?</strong>
</p>

<p>
How: Please see our <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/project_members.html">Getting involved</a> document.
</p>

<p>
Why: Because the need for a first class issue tracking system that 
is open source is badly needed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What is CollabNet's involvement in Scarab?</strong>
</p>

<p>
From the Lead Developer, Jon Stevens:
</p>

<p>
I originally started Turbine, Torque and Village with the hopes and dreams
that one day I would be able to create a great bug tracking system based on
those technologies that kicked the shit out of everything else out there.
</p>

<p>
I got lucky and was hired by CollabNet to make my dream a reality. The goal
was to always create something that could be integrated into SourceCast (so
that I could make CollabNet money to justify my hiring), but I have always
fought any pressure to make Scarab 'SourceCast specific'.
</p>

<p>
So, reality is that Scarab is unique in that it really is a homegrown
project. I just got lucky to find a corporation to sponsor the development of it.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks to Brian B. and CollabNet for supporting my dream.
</p>

<p><strong>How do I populate the database with my own issue types, attributes
and attribute options?</strong></p>

<p>
When you first install Scarab using the ./create-db.sh -e script,
you will get an empty database that is only populated with the
required data. Therefore, you will need to setup your installation
with new Modules, Issue types, Attributes and Attribute options.
</p>

<p>
Login as the Scarab Administer account that you created/defined
in your build.properties when you built Scarab.
</p>

<p>
#1. Create a new module.<br />
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage modules -> Create new module
</p>

<p>
#2. Select the module by clicking the 'Modules' link in the top-left
    of the screen.
</p>

<p>
#3. Now, create a new global issue type.<br />
    Admin -> Global -> Global issue types
</p>

<p>
#4. Add the new issue type to the module.<br />
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage issue types -> Create new
</p>

<p>
#5. Set the issue type to be active and shown in the left hand nav.<br />
    (should be the next screen after #4. if not, then it is:
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage issue types)
</p>

<p>
#6. Edit the issue type and create attributes and attribute options.<br />
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage issue types (click the issue type name).
</p>

<p>
#7. Add attributes to an attribute group.<br />
    (click the attribute group name on the 'Edit issue type' screen
    and then click the 'Add new' button. If there are no global attributes
    to add (most likely in this case), click the 'Create new' button to
    define a global attribute.)
</p>
    
<p>
#8. Defining an attribute and its options.<br />
    (Set the name/description/type of the attribute and then save it.
     If you have created a Dropdown list, then the ability to create
     attribute options will show up below. Simply add options and click
     Save. When you are done, click done and it will take you back to
     step #7. The attribute should also appear in the group.)
</p>

<p>
Continue to repeat the steps above until all of your issue types, attributes
and attribute options have been defined.
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p><strong>How do I setup Scarab so that it will send a copy of each issue
change to a particular email address (ie: a mailing list or the project leader)?</strong></p>

<p>
As either the module administrator or the domain administrator user, go
to the Admin->Modules->Manage modules screen and edit the particular
module that you are interested in tracking issue changes in. Set the
'Archive email' address to the email address that you want. Please note, do
not try to do this in the Global module, only modules which are children of 
the Global module.
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p><strong>When I receive notification email from scarab, the url to the
issue starts with http://localhost:8080/. Clearly that is bad because I
want the email to point to the server that Scarab is on. How to I make
it say the server domain name instead?</strong></p>

<p>
In order to have one fewer thing to have to configure, Scarab uses
whatever you type into the browser url as the url that is sent in the
emails. So, if your server name is foo.com, then going to
http://foo.com:8080/ instead of http://localhost:8080/ will generate the
right url in the emails.
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p><strong>How can I search across modules?</strong></p>

<p>This functionality has been added after 1.0-b9. Previous
versions of Scarab did not have this functionality.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p><strong>How can I set defaults for the various attributes on
issue entry?</strong></p>

<p>RIght now, that is what issue templates do. Click on the 'Templates'
link in the left hand side navigation, create the template and it will
then show up when you go to enter a new issue. You can create as many
templates as you wish and just 'apply' them when you enter a new issue.
A nice feature addition would be to have a setting on the template
administration screen that denotes which one should be automatically
applied.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p><strong>What is the process for upgrading Scarab?</strong></p>

<p>
The CollabNet Scarab developers provide MySQL database upgrade scripts
for each new version of Scarab. These scripts reside in the
scarab/src/sql/upgrade directory. Some of these scripts are .sql files
and some are unix shell .sh files. If you are using another database or 
system, we welcome your contributions to port these files.
</p>

<p>
If you have deployed Scarab with the default settings and are running
out of the default target directory, then you should download the new
version of Scarab, move the target directory into the new version of
Scarab, cd into target/webapps/scarab/WEB-INF and backup and remove the
following directories: classes, conf, lib, sql, src. You should be
careful to not remove the indexes and attachments directories (if they
exist). Once you have done that, you can build Scarab again following
the directions in the README.txt file. You should take note to create a
~/build.properties file which stores your changes to the Scarab settings
so that when you build again, your settings remain intact.

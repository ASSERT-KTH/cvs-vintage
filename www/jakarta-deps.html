<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
When building the dependencies for Scarab, there are several things to
consider. For example, some of the dependencies have a requirement to
set the Xerces parser to be the 1.4.x version instead of the 2.x
version.
</p>

<h4>Xerces notes</h4>

<p>
Projects which require to set the Xercies 1.4.x version (by creating a
$PROJECT/build.properties (xerces.jar=/path/to/xerces-1.4.4.jar):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>jakarta-turbine-3</li>
    <li>jakarta-turbine-fulcrum</li>
    <li>jakarta-turbine-torque</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fulcrum notes</h4>

<p>
The jakarta-turbine-fulcrum project MUST be built using the Scarab
build.xml: upgrade-fulcrum target. This is because a couple of build
time settings must be made when building fulcrum so that it can work
with the Scarab database. In order to use this target, the
jakarta-turbine-fulrcum project must be checked out in the same
directory where the scarab directory lives. It is suggested that you
first make sure that fulcrum will build on its own and then you can try
using Scarab's build system to build/upgrade fulcrum in Scarab.

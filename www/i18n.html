<h1>Scarab internationalization (i18n)</h1>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This document is meant to help you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>as a developer and/or translator if you want to develop the resources needed 
    to allow Scarab to be used in a new language;</li>
  <li>as an administrator if you are in charge of setting up a Scarab installation 
    in a language other than American/English.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A preliminary consideration</h2>
<p>Scarab uses directly or indirectly (Velocity) the Java programming language 
  and platform. Java has native support for Unicode, which can display and handle 
  all human languages in current use plus a few others, so it seems that the i18n 
  question is a simple question of translation, right&nbsp;?</p>
<p>The crude reality is that software currently used by Scarab or to communicate 
  with Scarab (operating systems, database management systems, web browsers, mail 
  clients,... ) have poor, immature or incomplete Unicode support. So, there is 
  no unique and general solution, and to provide i18n support compatible with 
  the tools most users use, we are compelled for now to encode/decode incoming 
  and outgoing streams of information.</p>
<h2>Scarab architecture explained for the purpose of i18n</h2>
<p>To understand how to set up Scarab to be used with a language other than American/English, 
  you need to have at least a general idea of what is going on inside the black 
  box.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="scarab-i18n.png" width="502" height="497"></p>
<p>Scarab as a web application relies heavily on an open source framework called 
  turbine. Two parts of turbine that are of interest to you as the administrator 
  of an international version are intake (the parameter processing part) and torque 
  (the object/relational mapping and persistence layer).</p>
<p>Using this internal machinery, Scarab delivers web pages and email messages 
  (output) and accepts form submissions (input).</p>
<p>Issue and module data plus a lot of other things necessary to Scarab operation 
  are stored in a database (MySQL, Postgresql and Oracle have been used so far).</p>
<h2>Which language does Scarab &quot;speak&quot; ?</h2>
<h3>User interface (screens)</h3>
<p>Scarab screens are designed and stored as a set of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html">Velocity</a> 
  templates (*.vm files). These templates have been made &quot;i18n-ready&quot; 
  by the development team using one of the standard Java mechanisms for internationalization: 
  <em>resource bundles.</em></p>
<p>The resource bundles are located under <strong>src/i18n</strong> and are named 
  ScarabBundle_<em>la_CC</em>.properties, where <em>la</em> is a valid language 
  code (as usual in Java and according to ISO-639, see <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">here</a>) 
  and <em>CC</em> a valid country code (as usual in Java and according to ISO-3166, 
  see <a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>So if you want Java to speak your language and nobody provided the necessary 
  resources until then, you must provide a resource bundle corresponding to your 
  language. This resource bundle must be encoded according to Unicode; but be 
  careful that the Java APIs only handle ASCII/ISO-Latin 1, so characters that 
  are not in the range \u0000-\u00ff must use the java notation for Unicode characters 
  \u<em>xxxx</em>. If your language contains a lot of non-ASCII, non-Latin characters, 
  it may not be practical for you to edit the resource bundle in this form; you 
  may consider using an editor with your own encoding and convert the file to 
  the &quot;canonical&quot; form at the end. On the Win32 platform, you may use 
  the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html">native2ascii</a> 
  JDK tool for this final conversion.</p>
<p>If you set up a Scarab installation for a language which cannot be written 
  using ISO-Latin1, you should uncomment and give a proper value to the <strong>locale.default.charset</strong> 
  key in the <strong>src/conf/Scarab.properties</strong> file (a file which most 
  users should not edit).</p>
<p>Scarab will attempt to deliver the UI in the user language using the browser 
  preferences (a turbine feature). If a resource bundle is found that matches 
  the user preferences, the UI is delivered in this language. If no resource bundle 
  can be found that matches the user preferences, UI is delivered in American/English 
  (en_US).</p>
<p>What about email messages ? It isn't that obvious... In fact, their sending 
  is triggered by an action performed by a user (such as changing an attribute) 
  and they are sent in this user preferred language. If all users of a given Scarab 
  instance have the same language preferences, which is probably the normal case, 
  the email messages are sent in their (common) language and this is usually not 
  an issue.</p>
<p>The question of (character) encoding is more sensitive for email messages than 
  it is for screen templates (because Unicode support in current email clients 
  often varies between insufficient and inexistent). If you are setting up a Scarab 
  installation for a non-Latin language, you should have a look at the I18N section 
  of the <strong>build/default.properties</strong> file and give an appropriate 
  value to the <strong>scarab.email.encoding</strong> key in your <strong>build.properties</strong> 
  file</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>It is pretty obvious that Scarab delivers the issue information in the language 
  in which they were entered.</p>
<p>One thing that you can change as a translator is the language of the default 
  and sample data that may be loaded at installation time. For this, you must 
  provide a second, much shorter, resource bundle called InitDbScarabBundle_<em>la</em>_<em>CC</em>.properties.</p>
<h2>Which language does Scarab &quot;understand&quot; ?</h2>
<p>So you understand now why the runbox, for instance, delivers contents to every 
  user in his/her own language (if the appropriate resource bundle is present 
  of course). This does not mean that a particular instance of Scarab is configured 
  to handle data in all languages on earth. The runbox, to continue with the example, 
  is not properly configured to handle and store Russian, Korean or Japanese data 
  -- though it is able to deliver the UI in these languages.</p>
<p>The problems with intake handling Chinese or Korean seem to have been solved 
  by now; there remains the question of storing non-Latin characters in the database. 
  If you plan to use a language which cannot be encoded with ISO-Latin1, you should 
  have a look at the I18N section of the build/default.properties file and give 
  an appropriate value to the <strong>scarab.database.encoding.querystring</strong> 
  key in your build.properties file.</p>

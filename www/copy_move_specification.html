<h2>Copy and move issue specification</h2>
<p>
The destination and actor can affect the results of a move or copy of an issue.
</p>
<h3>Move to different issue type within same module</h3>
<p>
This is implemented as a simple reclassification with minimal change to 
the issue data.  For example if a Defect is changed to Enhancement and then
back to Defect, it's attribute values will be unaltered.  History will be
intact.
Q: do inactive or missing attributes in the new type cause comments to be 
added?
</p>
<h3>Move to different module</h3>
<p>
As an issue type can have different variations between modules, a move between
modules is treated similarly whether the issue type remains the same or
changes.  Comments are added to the issue for attributes that are inactive
or missing in the new module.  
Q: do the attribute values that are commented on remain intact?  I.e. if the 
issue is moved back, will the attribute values still be set as before it
was moved?

The user must have the 'Issue | Move' permission in the source module and
'Issue | Enter' in the destination module to be able to move an issue across
modules.  If the user does not have 'Issue | Edit' permission in the new
module, user associations will be dropped.
Q: Are these changes entered as comments?

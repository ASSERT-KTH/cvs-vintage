<h3>Scarab.Tigris.org Community</h3>

<p>
Join the Scarab.Tigris.org community by <a
href="/servlets/Join">registering</a> with the site and then <a
href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">requesting</a> an 
<strong>Observer</strong> role within the Scarab project.
</p>

<h3>Mailing lists</h3>

<p>To get involved with the development of Scarab, please 
join the developer's <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing you should send when you join the list is to post an
    introduction message that tells the group:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Who you are</li>
    <li>Your interest in Issue Tracking</li>
    <li>The role you would like to play in the project (e.g., do you want to just 
        discuss ideas, write code, do UI design, or be an early users?), and</li>
    <li>The rough level of effort you expect to put (e.g., mainly lurking, a few 
        postings a week, a few evenings, several hours a week, this is part of my 
        full-time job).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Internet Relay Chat</h3>

<p>
We often "hang out" on IRC at irc.whichever.com:6667 #scarab. You are
welcome to come join us. We try to keep decision making on the mailing
list or at least post the IRC logs when we do make decisions over IRC.
However, if you need a quick answer to something or feel that email is
too slow of a communication forum, please join us. Please note, we may
be logged in, but not actually paying attention (we are busy working on
Scarab), so hang out for a bit (or send email to the mailing list) if no
one responds right way.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
We are always looking for volunteers to help with the development of
Scarab. We realize that many of the technologies that we are using may
be new to you. As a result, we are willing to help you get up to speed.
This will take a bit of time and patience on your part because you may
not be used to our style of doing things. This also means that in order
to do development, we will need you to take iniative and jump in
wherever you see things needing development or improvement. Do not be
afraid to suggest things on the mailing list or ask specific questions.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
The first place to start off with developing on Scarab is to download
the <a href="/servlets/ProjectSource">CVS tree</a> or a <a
href="http://www.apache.org/~jon/scarab/nightly/">nightly snapshot</a>
and explore the documentation, build system and code that is there
already. Build a "target" sandbox, startup Tomcat and explore the
templates that are already there. Analyze the database design and look
at the files in the src/sql directory (the default-data and sample-data)
files are very helpful. The README.txt file documents everything
necessary to get a Scarab installation up and running. It's easy.
</p>

<h3>Finding something to do</h3>

<p>
Please read through the archives of the developer mailing list to get a
feeling for how we work together and the different characters working on
the project. If you have questions, do not hesistate to ask.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in choosing something to fix right away, please
look at <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issuezilla</a>
and find an issue you can fix or comment on. If you have a patch to fix
some code, please upload it to Issuezilla as an attachment. If you have
a question about one of the issues, make a comment.
</p>

<p>
If there is nothing that immediately sparks your interest, but you still
want to contribute, please send email to the mailing list with
suggestions for things that you would like to work on as well as what
your skill set is. We would like to think of this as your project as
well. If you just start contributing things as you see fit, then chances
are we will accept those contributions or tell you how to do things the
way that we would like to see them done.

            <p>This project is just getting off the ground. We are looking for developers 
                who are interested in sharing their ideas and getting down to coding 
                in the near future. </p>
            <p> To get involved, join the developer's mailing list by sending email 
                to <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@scarab.tigris.org">dev-subscribe@scarab.tigris.org</a>. 
            </p>
            <p> The first thing you should do when you join the list is to post 
                an introduction message that tells the group: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>who you are, </li>
                <li>your interest in bug tracking,</li>
                <li>the role you would like to play in the project (e.g., do you 
                    want to just discuss ideas, write code, do UI design, or be 
                    an early users?), and</li>
                <li>the rough level of effort you expect to put (e.g., mainly lurking, 
                    a few postings a week, a few evenings, several hours a week, 
                    this is part of my full-time job).</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We have started a page of <a href="./introductions.html">introductions</a> 
                which is an archived set of introduction posts to the mailing lists.

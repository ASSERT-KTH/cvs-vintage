<p>To get involved with the development of Scarab, please 
join the developer's <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing you should send when you join the list is to post an
    introduction message that tells the group:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Who you are</li>
    <li>Your interest in Issue Tracking</li>
    <li>The role you would like to play in the project (e.g., do you want to just 
        discuss ideas, write code, do UI design, or be an early users?), and</li>
    <li>The rough level of effort you expect to put (e.g., mainly lurking, a few 
        postings a week, a few evenings, several hours a week, this is part of my 
        full-time job).</li>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
We are always looking for volunteers to help with the development of
Scarab. We realize that many of the technologies that we are using may
be new to you. As a result, we are willing to help you get up to speed.
This will take a bit of time and patience on your part because you may
not be used to our style of doing things. This also means that in order
to do development, we will need you to take iniative and jump in
wherever you see things needing development or improvement. Do not be
afraid to suggest things on the mailing list or ask specific questions.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
The first place to start off with developing on Scarab is to download
the <a href="/servlets/ProjectSource">CVS tree</a> and explore the
documentation, build system and code that is there already. Build a
"target" sandbox, startup Tomcat and explore the templates that are
already there. Analyze the database design and look at the files in the
src/sql directory (the default-data and sample-data) files are very
helpful.
</p>

<h3>Finding something to do</h3>

<p>
If there is nothing that immediately sparks your interest, but you still
want to contribute, please send email to the mailing list with
suggestions for things that you would like to work on as well as what
your skill set is. We would like to think of this as your project as
well. If you just start contributing things as you see fit, then chances
are we will accept those contributions or tell you how to do things the
way that we would like to see them done.
</p>

<p>
Please note: Once we have UI and IA further along, we will be able to
hand people a set of screens and say: "make these work". If you need
help making them work, then we are available to discuss things online on
the mailing list. Do not be afraid to ask questions.

            If one of these existing reports is very close to your issue, you can 
            simply vote for it rather than entering a new bug. A new issue report 
            starts with 0 votes, so if you want to see the issue resolved, it is 
            better to combine votes that divide them by entering duplicate reports.<br>

<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bold, red text helps people see the relationship at a glance 
    <li>The explanation at the bottom must be clear to first time users, and clearly 
        discourage duplicate entries 
    <li>&quot;Find other related issue&quot; goes to the query page with the same 
        search critera, but the user can edit before launching the search 
    <li>If there are no related issues, skip this step. Note that steps are not 
        refered to by number, since numbering varies

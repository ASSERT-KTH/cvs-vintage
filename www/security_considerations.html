<p>This document describes the different aspects of the system that will need to 
    be secured at some point. Currently, during development, the application is 
    being built with very little security in place. The system is there to do the 
    security (thanks to Turbine's Role/Permission security scheme), it just has 
    not been implemented yet in Scarab. The reason is that this will take quite 
    a bit of consideration and analysis of the entire application as a whole. For 
    instance, when editing a project, one must make sure that only the owner of 
    the project (or whomever the owner gives permission to) can actually edit the 
    project. 
<p>only people who have permission to edit projects, components, etc can do so. 
    <br>
    only people who have permission to view certain screens and actions can do so. 
    <br>
    only people who have logged in can view certain screens and actions 
<p>more to be added later... <br>

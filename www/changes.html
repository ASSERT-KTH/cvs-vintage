            <h3>Changes since 1.0b3</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wizard3.vm: changed label from "go to start page" to
                    "return to issue types index". (JSS)</li>
                <li>Online help documentation is now active and
                    integrated into Scarab. We will be fleshing out the 
                    rest of the content over the next couple beta's.
                    (JSS, JDM, TB, TF)</li>
                <li>Continued to clean up several templates HTML so that
                    it is up to the CSS stylesheets spec as well as 
                    the UI mockups. (JSS, JDM, ED, TF)</li>                    
                <li>Removed SCARAB_ISSUE_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE, 
                    SCARAB_R_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_WORD, and SCARAB_WORD tables as 
                    they were not used. (JDM)</li>
                <li>Automatically add issue type to module if user came 
                    from ManageIssueTypes screen, and return to that 
                    screen instead of making them add issue type in extra 
                    step. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Changed the build system to default to having Velocity 
                    template caching on in the Scarab distributions. It is
                    still default off in the nightly/cvs distributions. 
                    (JSS)</li>
                <li>Modified the build system to use Torque to generate
                    the Turbine schema's from .xml files. This should help
                    pave the way towards making it easier to port Scarab 
                    to other database systems than MySQL. More community
                    help is needed to get this to 100%. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Workflow: when creating a new issue type or attribute 
                    to add to a module, return back to module page instead 
                    of the select page. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Removed location column from EditQuery.vm because BrianO
                    says it isn't needed. (JSS)</li>

            <h3>Fixes since 1.0b3</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the case of multiple parents for an
                    AttributeOption, parents were not displaying on
                    ModuleAttributeEdit. Fixed. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Fixed functionality to inactivate attribute groups.
                    (And their attributes) (EWD)</li>
                <li>Broke up attributes into their groups on View Issue
                <li>Can now save a query first without submitting it. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Patch to set the DATABASE_DRIVER in the TR.props
                    based on what is in the default/build.properties file
                    instead of being hard coded. Thanks to: Jean-François El Fouly
                    (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem with the creation of new Modules. The AttributeGroups
                    of the parent module were not copied. See also Bug Report 
                    #<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=191">191</a>
                    (MC)</li>
                <li>Upgraded the MySQL driver to 2.0.11 because someone reported
                    "Unexpected end of input stream" errors in Issuezilla at one
                    point and this version promises to fix those problems. (JSS).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Live debugging is now conditional. You can turn it on 
                    by adding: /debug/true to the url. It will then become 'sticky'
                    and all links will include it. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Added patch from Thierry Lach to allow creation of a war file
                    via the build.xml. (JSS)</li>
                <li>MySQL 3.23 or higher is required now. This is due to problems in 
                    3.22 that seem to be resolved in 3.23. MySQL 4.0.x is untested, but
                    should also work fine. (JSS)</li>
                <li>A light version (JSP is disabled) of Tomcat 4.0.2 is now 
                    distributed with Scarab. It has numerous fixes and improvements 
                    over 4.0.1 (JSS)</li>

                <li>Allow special characters in the summary of a new issue. (See Bug Report 
                    #<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=177">177</a>) (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed the module name display to always show the delim properly. With sample data,
                    Turbine &gt; SourceJava turned into Turbine &gt; Source &gt; Java (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed the Login page to always send one to SelectModule if the next
                    template is set to Login.vm. The issue was that after confirming registration,
                    one would login and would not go to SelectModule.vm after that, leading
                    to confusing behavior. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed error in adding an attribute to an issue type. (EWD)</li>
                <li>For AssignIssue, updated the activity records being saved and emails being sent when users are associated or un-associated with an issue.(EWD)</li>
                <li>Fixed the logic surrounding setting the parent
                module when editing module information. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed the sequencing of attributes in an attribute group by adding method that retrieves highest sequence. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Fixed some inconsistent use of terminology. (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed some small HTML errors. (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed some macro-calls where not enough arguments were passed. (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed bug in getting RModuleAttribute which was causing errors on ConfigureIssueList.(EWD)</li>

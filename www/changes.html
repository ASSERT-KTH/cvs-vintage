            <ul>
                <li>Live debugging is now conditional. You can turn it on 
                    by adding: /debug/true to the url. It will then become 'sticky'
                    and all links will include it. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Added patch from Thierry Lach to allow creation of a war file
                    via the build.xml. (JSS)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fixes since 1.0b2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated Wizard2.vm to match the UI mockups (NR)</li>
                <li>Bug Report #<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=174">174</a> (JSS)</li>

                <li>Bug Report #<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=177">177</a> (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed the module name display to always show the delim properly. With sample data,
                    Turbine &gt; SourceJava turned into Turbine &gt; Source &gt; Java (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed the Login page to always send one to SelectModule if the next
                    template is set to Login.vm. The issue was that after confirming registration,
                    one would login and would not go to SelectModule.vm after that, leading
                    to confusing behavior. (JSS)</li>

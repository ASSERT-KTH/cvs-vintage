            <h3>Changes since 1.0b13</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue lookup is now case-insensitive for databases other than mySql. (TL)</li>
                <li>Nightly <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net/">Checkstyle</a> 
                    reports are now sent to the dev@scarab mailing list. 1.0 will not be released
                    until we hit zero errors. Please contribute patches to fix the errors.
                <li>The build system now only copies the appropriate database
                    .jar file into WEB-INF/lib and also separates out the definition
                    of the various databases into their own .properties files which
                    can and should be overridden in your own build.properties.
                    See #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB242">SCB242</a>. (JSS)</li>
                <li>The update search index screen now uses a background
                    thread and a page refresh to do its work so that 
                    browser/server timeouts don't affect the process. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Upgraded to Postgres 7.3 JDBC driver. (JSS)</li>
                <li>If there are two modules a user could have and one
                    of them is global and the other isn't, then always
                    pick the non-global one and take them directly into
                    it on login. (JSS)</li>
                <li>It is no longer possible for child issues to delete
                    dependency relationships with parent issues. Only the 
                    parent can do this delete operation. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Hide the parent/child information for now because it is 
                    confusing. It is possible to determine the relationship 
                    by whether or not there is a select button for delete. (JSS)</li>
                <li>The way issue dependencies are stored in the database has changed 
                    and is vastly improved over previous versions. The emails 
                    which are sent are better and the information which is stored
                    is now stored correctly. mysql-upgrade-1.0b13-1.0b14-8.sql is
                    the upgrade script for the changes. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Updated to the latest tigris.css from the 
                    www/csi/style directory. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Display the created date for attachments. (JSS)</li>
                <li>A single method (Issue.addComment()) is used for adding
                    comments through the various UI elements. This makes 
                    for a more consistent recording of comments. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Notes added on the dedupe screen are now properly recorded
                    as activities and an email is sent when the note is added.
                    (JSS)</li>
                <li>Added Japanese translation based on b13. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Show the number of hidden comments on the comments tab
                    when not all are shown.  (TL)</li>
                <li>Added pre-creation of tables in Oracle
                    ant install.  It is now possible to
                    create an Oracle schema using <code>ant create-db</code>
                    without the table deletes causing it to fail.  (TL)</li>
                <li>Added login name to Delete User screen.  (TL)</li>
                <li>Lots of code cleanup (removed unused imports, unnecessary casts, 
                    strange logic, etc). Thanks to Jerome Lacoste for his 
                    massive patches. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Changed index names which tried to create identically-named
                    indexes on different tables, which Oracle does not allow
                    (Oracle requires indexes to be uniquely named within a
                    schema, MySQL requires indexes to be uniquely named on a table).
                    For more information see #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB231">SCB231</a>. (TL)</li>
                <li>A minimal distribution of Tomcat 4.1.18 is now the default 
                    servlet engine bundled and used with Scarab. We should see a bit of a 
                    performance increase over 4.0.6. Note: this version has been
                    stripped of all extra .jar files which are not necessary
                    for Scarab to run. So, this isn't a complete distribution
                    of Tomcat by any means. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Replaced viewIssue macro with modular, rendered,
                    and more maintainable velocity macro scripts. (TL)</li>
                <li><strong>Changed the way that proxyName/proxyPort is defined
                    in your build.properties file. If you have defined
                    this, then you need to fix your settings!</strong> Before:
                    scarab.tomcat.proxy.name=your.server.name and
                    scarab.tomcat.proxy.port=80 After:
                    scarab.tomcat.proxy.name=proxyName="your.server.name
                    " and scarab.tomcat.proxy.port=proxyPort="80". This
                    was done to work around a bug in Tomcat which
                    manifested itself as users reporting that the emails
                    were missing the domain name. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Remove "Add new" button from URL section on ViewIssue.
                For more information see #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB277">SCB277</a>. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Added an All option to the Results Per Page chooser. For more information, see Enhancement request
                    #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB168">SCB168</a> (JDM)</li>
                <li>Changed sort links on IssueList.vm to maintain results per page and current page info. (JDM)</li>
                <li>Add Issue | Move permission. See #PCN12339. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Give error message when missing required fields on Report
                    Issue. See #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB278">SCB278</a>. (EWD)</li>
                <li>AssignIssue: associated users now saved in the session. Only one
                    attachment is now saved per transaction. Bug report #PCN 12634. (EWD)</li>
                <li>For single-module and single-issueType queries, use module-
                    specific name for attribute.
                    See #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB349">SCB349</a>. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Can now unset a set attribute. 
                    See #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB256">SCB256</a>. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Cached search results for duration of a request so that the
                    results are not recalculated several times.  And pass a
                    short list of ids in the urls that go from IssueList.vm to                     ViewIssue.vm, so that some navigation by prev/next links
                    is possible without repeating the search. (JDM)</li>
                <li>Users with only View permission can now see all tabs on
                    ViewIssue.
                    See #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB307">SCB307</a>. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Fixed "Show complete history" links so they stay in history tab. (EWD)</li>
                <li>No longer creating a history record for null string attributes when entering an issue.
                    See #<a href="http://issues.whichever.com/issues/id/SCB156">SCB156</a>. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Update UI for Move Issue. Make it possible to add a reason for move and to move /copy to a new issue type.  See Bug Report PCN#13098. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Added openoffice file extensions to the auto-detect 
                    mime.types file.  See Bug Report PCN#11769. (JDM)</li>
                <li>When removing a user assignment, set end_dates for the remove activity and other activites on this attribute and user. Also, when changing a user from one attribute to another, create two activites, one for a deleting and one for adding to the new attribute. (EWD) </li>
                <li>Comments are now associated with Activity records,rather than ActivitySet (Transaction) records. (EWD) </li> 
                <li>Cannot delete issue types with issues; issues from inactive issue types are read-only. For more information see PCN # 14245 (EWD)</li>
                <li>If encounter an error while creating global attribute, do not show created date information. (EWD) For more information see PCN #14229 </li>
                <li>Can no longer add a user to the Advanced Query page screen. For more information see PCN #14372 (EWD)</li>
                <li>The cross-module/issue type query will persist when adding users to the Advanced Query screen. For more information see PCN #14146. (EWD) </li>
                <li>Check for query name before allowing edit of saved query. PCN #14595 (EWD)</li>

                    groups. Took out ability to add a global issue type from the

                    domain portion of the email address has a valid A record
                    during the registration process. This will help prevent

                    resulted in a NumberFormatException when later saving
                    the issue type.  This was due to not updating a cached

                <li>Modified the build system to use Torque to generate
                    the Turbine schema's from .xml files. This should help
                    pave the way towards making it easier to port Scarab

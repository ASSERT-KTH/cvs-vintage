            <ul>
                <li>Wizard3.vm: changed label from "go to start page" to
                    "return to issue types index". (JSS)</li>
                <li>Online help documentation is now active and
                    integrated into Scarab. We will be fleshing out the 
                    rest of the content over the next couple beta's.
                    (JSS, JDM, TB, TF)</li>
                <li>Continued to clean up several templates HTML so that
                    it is up to the CSS stylesheets spec as well as 
                    the UI mockups. (JSS, JDM, ED, TF)</li>

                <li>In the case of multiple parents for an
                    AttributeOption, parents were not displaying on
                    ModuleAttributeEdit. Fixed. (EWD)</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Live debugging is now conditional. You can turn it on 
                    by adding: /debug/true to the url. It will then become 'sticky'
                    and all links will include it. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Added patch from Thierry Lach to allow creation of a war file
                    via the build.xml. (JSS)</li>
                <li>MySQL 3.23 or higher is required now. This is due to problems in 
                    3.22 that seem to be resolved in 3.23. MySQL 4.0.x is untested, but
                    should also work fine. (JSS)</li>
                <li>A light version (JSP is disabled) of Tomcat 4.0.2 is now 
                    distributed with Scarab. It has numerous fixes and improvements 
                    over 4.0.1 (JSS)</li>

                <li>Fixed the module name display to always show the delim properly. With sample data,
                    Turbine &gt; SourceJava turned into Turbine &gt; Source &gt; Java (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed the Login page to always send one to SelectModule if the next
                    template is set to Login.vm. The issue was that after confirming registration,
                    one would login and would not go to SelectModule.vm after that, leading
                    to confusing behavior. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed error in adding an attribute to an issue type. (EWD)</li>
                <li>For AssignIssue, updated the activity records being saved and emails being sent when users are associated or un-associated with an issue.(EWD)</li>

                module when editing module information. (JSS)</li>
                <li>Fixed the sequencing of attributes in an attribute group by adding method that retrieves highest sequence. (EWD)</li>
                <li>Fixed some inconsistent use of terminology. (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed some small HTML errors. (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed some macro-calls where not enough arguments were passed. (MC)</li>
                <li>Fixed bug in getting RModuleAttribute which was causing errors on ConfigureIssueList.(EWD)</li>

<p><b><font color="#00315A" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CVS Repository:</font> 
    </b></p>
<p> To access the CVS source code repository use the following CVSROOT: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>:pserver:guest@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs</tt></b> </p>
<p> You may also use the login "guest" with password "guest" to gain read-only CVS 
    access. If you have been given write access to the CVS repository, then replace 
    "guest@cvs.tigris.org" with your own login (e.g., "my_login@cvs.tigris.org") 
    and use your own tigris user password. </p>
<p> The module you should checkout is "scarab/src". That is the top-level module 
    that contain the entire source code tree for the Scarab project. </p>
<p> The way most people contribute changes is to email a "patch" to one of the "module 
    owners". These are developers who are responsible for certain sections of the 
    code (called modules). There is a list of module owners <a
href="/project_members.html">here</a>. Once a module owner 
    sees your contribibution, he or she will review it and integrate it into the 
    source code repository. </p>
<p> For more information on using CVS, documentation, and CVS clients, click on 
    the "Tool Docs" menu at left and select the "Source/CVS" option. Or, click <a href="http://www.tigris.org/tools/cvs.html">here</a>.

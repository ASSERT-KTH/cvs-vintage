<h2>Scarab - Issues</h2>

<p>
As of 7-9-2002, Scarab has been self hosting!
</p>

<p> If you would like to submit an issue, please
<strong>check</strong> the <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/source/browse/scarab/KNOWN_ISSUES.txt?rev=HEAD"
target="_new">KNOWN_ISSUES.txt</a> file to make sure that we don't
already know about an issue that may not necessarily have a particular
issue the problem is reported against.
</p>

<p>
After searching the issue tracker and you really do have an original problem to report, 
then please report it using our 
<a href="http://scarab.collab.net/">issue tracker</a>. Register and
create a new account. Make sure to request a DEVELOPER role. Please 
include a detailed message that describes the problem (make it as easy
as possible to understand), how to reproduce the problem and a stack
trace if one is generated.  Make sure the the email address you register with is
subscribed to the developer mailing list so that emails generated by Scarab are
properly sent to the mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE: Please do not use the issue tracker to create
test issues</strong>. You can use our runbox (available again soon)
to create as many test issues as you want.
</p>

<p>
If the issue tracker is unavailable or you have a problem with it,
please contact <a href="mailto:dev@scarab.tigris.org">the developers</a>
and let them know.

<h2>Scarab - Issues</h2>

<p>
As of 7-9-2002, Scarab is now self hosting!
</p>

<p>
Scarab is now used to track Scarab issues. Previously, we were using the
Tigris.org IssueZilla issue tracker. <strong>Do not submit new issues
into Issuezilla.</strong> Please note that we have not finished the
migration from the old system to the new system quite yet, so please be
patient.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to submit an issue, please <strong>check</strong> the 
<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/source/browse/~checkout~/scarab/KNOWN_ISSUES.txt" target="_new">KNOWN_ISSUES.txt</a> 
file to make sure that we don't already know about an issue that may not necessarily have
a particular issue the problem is reported against.
</p>

<p>
After searching the issue tracker and you really do have an original problem to report, 
then please report it using our 
<a href="http://scarab.collab.net/">new issue tracker</a>. Register and
create a new account. Make sure to request a DEVELOPER role. Please 
include a detailed message that describes the problem (make it as easy
as possible to understand), how to reproduce the problem and a stack
trace if one is generated.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE: Please do not use the new issue tracker to create
test issues</strong>. You can use our <a
href="http://scarab.whichever.com/">runbox</a> to create as many test
issues as you want.
</p>

<p>
If the new issue tracker is unavailable or you have a problem with it,
please contact <a href="mailto:dlr@collab.net">Daniel Rall</a> and let him know.

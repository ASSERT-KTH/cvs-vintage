<h2>Scarab - Issues</h2>

<p>
As of 7-9-2002, Scarab is now self hosting!
</p>

<p>
Scarab is now used to track Scarab issues. Previously, we were using the
Tigris.org IssueZilla issue tracker. Please note that we have not
finished the migration from the old system to the new system quite yet,
so please be patient.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to submit an issue, please search the <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">old issue
tracker</a> first to see if the problem has already been reported. If you cannot
find a problem, then submit it to our <a href="http://scarab.whichever.com:8081/scarab/servlet/scarab">new issue tracker</a> (ie: the Scarab one).
</p>

<p>
Also, please make sure to check the 
<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/source/browse/~checkout~/scarab/KNOWN_ISSUES.txt" target="_new">KNOWN_ISSUES.txt</a> 
file to make sure that we don't already know about an issue that may not necessarily have
a particular issue the problem is reported against.
</p>

<p>
If the new issue tracker is unavailable or you have a problem with it,
please contact <a href="mailto:jon@latchkey.com">Jon</a> and let him know.

		<h2>Issue Entry</h2>
		<p><b><a name="a">Selecting an issue (artifact) type</a></b></p>
		Artifacts refer to the categories of issues available in your current module. 
		Be careful to assign your issue to the appropriate artifact category. The default 
		types are defect, patch, task, feature, and enhancements. 
		<ul>
		<li><b>Defects</b> are issues identified within existing feature/functionality.</li>
		<li><b>Patches</b> are edits submitted as fixes to defects.</li>
		<li><b>Tasks</b> describe undertakings required for the support of a Feature 
		or enhancement. Tasks can be upgrading software to support new functionality, 
		reviewing similar projects to discover how similar problems were solved, or 
		reading up on a new technology.</li>
		<li><b>Features</b> are new functionality to be incorporated into the project</li>
		<li><b>Enhancements</b> are improvements to existing features.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once you have selected the artifact type that best describes your issue, click 
		on the name of the artifact. The <b>Enter issue</b> screen will appear.</p>

		<p><b><a name="b">Entering an issue, long format</a></p></b>
		<p>Entering an issue is a three step process. </p>
		<ol>
		<li>Enter brief descriptive information about your issue</li>
		<li>Check the database for duplicates of your issue. </li>
		<li>Enter a full description and save the issue to the database.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><b>Step 1: Enter descriptive information.</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Summary: a brief statement describing the issue. Considering using keywords 
		in this field.</li>
		<li>Platform: select the affected platform from the drop down list.</li>
		<li>Operating system: select the affected platform from the drop down list.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Click the &quot;Check for duplicates&quot; button to continue.</p>
		<p><b>Step2: Check for duplicates</b></p>
		<p>Once you've clicked the &quot;Check for duplicates&quot; button the database 
		is scanned for similar issues <i>how deeply in depth should we go with the process 
		by which this is done?</i> </p>
		<p>If duplicates are found a report of similar issues will be presented with your 
		issue listed at the top. Review the issues listed for fit. You can do a number 
		of things at this point:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Review individual issues by clicking on their id. The full issue description 
		will appear. </li>
		<li>Sort issues by each of the categories. Click on the name of the category 
		to change the sort order</li>
		<li>Alter one or more issues at the same time. Click on the check box to the 
		left of the issue ids that you would like to manipulate. You can then enter 
		a note in the <b>note</b> field and click the <b>submit note only</b> button 
		to add a note to the comments section of all issues selected. Additionally, 
		you can add a vote to the issues you've selected by clicking the <b>add vote 
		to selected</b> button.</li>
		<li>Skip this process by clicking on the <b>bypass duplicates</b> button.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Step 3: Enter a full description - Verbose form</b></p>
		<p>The Verbose Info screen allows you to add detailed information about your issue. 
		Required fields have an * (astrick) beside their title. You should be as descriptive 
		as possible. Use all of the attributes to describe your issue.</p>

		<hr>
		<p><b><a name="c">Setting dependencies</a></b></p>
		<p>Issues often have dependencis on other issues. One issue may require a resolution 
		from another before any work can be done. Two issues may have parellel resolutions 
		and need to be tracked together, though they have no direct influence on one 
		another. Dependencies are defined as parent/child relationships within Scarab. 
		Child issues are those with defined dependencies on other issues. </p>
		<p>There are three levels of dependencies within Scarab: blocking ,duplicating 
		and non-blocking. Blocking issues prevent the issue being blocked, from being 
		resolved. The blocking issue must be addressed before the blocked issue can 
		be resolved.</p>
		<p>Sometime duplicate issues may be entered and need to be tracked seperately. 
		Marking an issue as a duplicate allows users to track efforts on both issues. 
		Duplicates may be in different modules or the same module.</p>
		<p>Marking issues as non-blocking dependencies also allows users to simultaneously 
		track efforts on two or more issues.</p>
		<p>You can track the progress of interrelated issues by using the <b>Dependencies</b> 
		section of the issue and clicking on either the issue id or the Issue summary 
		links to the issues. In this area you can also redefine the Dependency type.</p>

		<hr>
		<p><b><a name="d">Issue attachments</a></b></p>
		<p>You can include an attachment for the issue. To do so, enter a brief description 
		of the attachement and use the browse button to navigate to the file on your 
		local system or enter a path for the file.</p>
		<div><a href="#top"><img src="../csi/images/up_pointer.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<small><a href="#top" title="return to top of document">top</a></small></div>
		
		<hr>
		<p><b><a name="e">Where to go from here</a></b></p>
		<p>After completing the issue entry process you can select where to go from there. 
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Enter new issue</li>
		<li>Start page</li>
		<li>Assign issue</li>
		</ul>

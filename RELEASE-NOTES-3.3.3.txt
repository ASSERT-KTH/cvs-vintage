Configuration:

Bug No.  Description

31592    Added 'digestEncoding' attribute to all Realms to specify the charset
         to be used when digesting passwords.

Connectors:

Bug No.  Description

         Disable the use of AJP/1.3 shutdown in the CoyoteConnector by default 
         (at least until it is supported).

         Removed the default use of 'conf/jk2.properties' by default for the
         AJP/1.3 CoyoteConnector.  To get the previous behavior, set the
         propertiesFile="conf/jk2.properties" attribute on the CoyoteConnector.

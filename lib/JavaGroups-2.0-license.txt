The JavaGroups-2.0.jar is a compile-time dependency of JCS (jcs-1.0-dev.jar),
though Scarab does not make use of its functionality, testing has not been
done to determine if a runtime dependency exists.

The code in JavaGroups-2.0.jar is covered by the LGPL license.
The LGPL is quite lengthy and full of complex legal wording and
its full implications are difficult to ascertain without some
rulings by the courts.  As such the JavaGroups developers have
added clarifications at the following url:

In the event this page changes, here was the text as of the 2.0 release:

JavaGroups is open source licensed under the Library (or Lesser) GNU
Public License (LGPL). Here are the main features of the LGPL with
respect to its use by commercial products:

    * A commercial product can use JavaGroups (as a library) without
having to become open source under the LGPL. (This is the big difference
to the GPL, where applications using it must be licensed under the GPL
as well.) So, if you for example use JavaGroups to write a product for
clustering an application server, you can sell this product without any
restrictions (ship it with JavaGroups included) and you do not have to
make your application open source.
    * If an application makes modifications to JavaGroups itself, the
modifications (not the application !) have to be sourced back into
JavaGroups. Typically, how this works is that you will contact the
JavaGroups project with the modifications for JavaGroups, and we then
decide whether to incorporate them into JavaGroups, or not.

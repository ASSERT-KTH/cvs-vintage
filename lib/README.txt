The files in this directory are here for your convenience in building
and using Scarab. The versions included with Scarab are known to be
working with Scarab. If you decide to use another version of these
libraries, unless otherwise noted (like with servlet.jar), no support
will be provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORE LIBRARIES
==============
These libraries are critical to the basic Scarab functionality and are
required no matter what optional services you use. Many of the JAR files
are included as a result of one JAR depending on another JAR for
functionality. In nearly every case, we attempt to focus our development
to only rely on Share.whichever.com, Sun and Jakarta Apache JAR files
because these projects are well known to the open source community and
considered 'standard' and well supported in our community circles.

* activation-*.jar

  JavaBeans Activation Framework. Required by JavaMail.  Part of Java
  2 Enterprise Edition.

* commons-collections.jar

  There are certain holes left unfilled by Sun's implementations of
  Collections, and the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives to
  fulfill them.

  http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections.html

* commons-digester*.jar

  The Digester package lets you configure an XML -> Java object mapping
  module, which triggers certain actions called rules whenever a
  particular pattern of nested XML elements is recognized.

  XPath and XSLT on the Java platform using the Java Collections
  Framework and with full support for DOM, SAX and JAXP.

  that allows one to manage users/roles/permissions.

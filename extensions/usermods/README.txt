None of the files in this directory structure should be committed to the Scarab CVS repository.

Any user modifications may be placed into either the lib directory or the appropriate subdirectory
of templates, and will be copied into the appropriate directories under the target directory.

Any files in this directory hierarchy will replace identically named files in the standard Scarab
distribution.

This simplifies the process of customizing *.vm files, for example.

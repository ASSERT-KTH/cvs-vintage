Scarab Quick Start Guide
========================

Welcome to Scarab! This document will help you get Scarab up and running
as quickly as possible, with the minimum of fuss.

Before we get started, I am assuming that you already have Ant 1.5.x
installed and configured on your system. Ant 1.6.x is currently not
supported because people have been reporting problems with it.

I also assume that you have a database server up and running, preferably
one supported by Scarab ;) We currently fully support both MySQL and
PostgreSQL, but there is also partial support for MS SQL Server, Oracle
and Hypersonic, although the latter is likely to become the default
database bundled with Scarab in the not too distant future.

And so, on to business...


Step 1: Unpack the Scarab distribution
----------------------------------------

The Scarab release can be downloaded as either a .zip or a .tar.gz file.
Unpack either one of these into a directory that you have write access
to. Of course, if you are reading this document, you have probably already
completed this step.


Step 2: Migrating an old version of Scarab
------------------------------------------

For those of you that have an existing version of Scarab between b16 and
b18-1 inclusive, copy your 'build.properties' file into your
'scarab-1.0-b19/build' directory and run the following ant target from
that directory:

$ ant migrate-b18-b19

If you don't have an existing Scarab installation, or you don't want to
keep your old settings, then you can skip this step.


Step 3: Build Scarab
--------------------

Before you build Scarab, you will almost certainly want to configure it.
So, if you don't already have one, now would be a good time to create a
'build.properties' file in your 'scarab-1.0-b19/build' directory. This is
just a standard java properties file containing property values relevant
to the Scarab build.

The file 'scarab-1.0-b19/build/default.properties' describes the properties 
that you can set and also contains default values, but at a bare minimum I
suggest you provide values for the following:

  scarab.database.type     - Your database provider. This can be one of:
                             mysql, postgresql, mssql, hypersonic, oracle
                             or db2.

  scarab.database.username - The username and password that Scarab should
  scarab.database.password   use to connect to the database.

  scarab.database.name     - The name of the Scarab database. This doesn't
                             have to exist yet. By default this is "scarab".

  scarab.database.host     - This is the name of the host running the
                             database. By default this is set to "localhost".

OK, once your 'build.properties' file is ready, just run ant from
'scarab-1.0-b19/build':

$ ant


Step 4: Create the database
---------------------------

Now you can create and populate the Scarab database. For non-PostgreSQL
users, just run:

$ ant create-db

or

$ ant -Dskip.seed.data create-db

if you do *not* want the sample Scarab data. If you are just testing
Scarab out, then we recommend that you use the first option and load the
sample data into the database.

The ant build will not successfully create the database in PostgreSQL,
so users of this database provider need to follow a different route.
Full instructions can be found in the 'PostgreSQL.txt' file in the same
directory as this one.


Step 5: Start Tomcat
--------------------

On Windows, just double-click on the 'scarab-1.0-b19/tomcat/bin/startup.bat'
file. On Unix/Linux, just run the 'scarab-1.0-b19/tomcat/bin/startup.sh'
script.

Point your browser at http://localhost:8080/scarab/issues/ and you should
be presented with the Scarab login page. If you do, congratulations! You
now have Scarab installed and running on your system.

If any of the above steps fail, then please read the full README.txt file.

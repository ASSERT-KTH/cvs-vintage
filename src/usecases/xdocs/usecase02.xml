    <actor name="Project Participant">wants to be able to specify issue
      unamgiously via an easy-to-type-or-say string.  This is often
      done via email, in code comments, in chat, or verbally on phone
      or in meetings.  Challenge is that unambiguous specification is
      at odds with brevity.  Assumes project name or URL as shared
      knowledge.

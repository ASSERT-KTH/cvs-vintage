/**
 * <p>The collection of static configuration information that describes a
 * Struts-based application module.  Multiple application modules
 * are identified by a <em>prefix</em> at the beginning of the context
 * relative portion of the request URI.  If no application prefix can be
 * matched, the default configuration (with a prefix equal to a zero-length
 * string) is selected, which is elegantly backwards compatible with the
 * previous Struts behavior that only supported one application.</p>

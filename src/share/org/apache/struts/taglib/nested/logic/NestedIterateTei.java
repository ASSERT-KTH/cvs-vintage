/**
 * NestedIterateTei
 * Extending the original tag's tei class, so that we can make the "id"
 * attribute optional, so that those who want to script can add it if they need
 * it otherwise we can maintain the nice lean tag markup.
 *
 *  TODO - Look at deleting this class. Potentially a pointless existance now
 *         that the super class is towing the line. Left alone because it's not
 *         hurting anything as-is.
 *         Note: When done, it requires pointing the tei reference in the
 *               struts-nested.tld to org.apache.struts.taglib.logic.IterateTei

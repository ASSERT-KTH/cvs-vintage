 * <p>A standard <strong>Action</strong> that switches to a new sub-application
 * and then forards control to a URI (specified in a number of possible ways)
 * within the new sub-application.</p>
 *
 * <p>Valid request parameters for this Action are:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>page</strong> - Application-relative URI (beginning with "/")
 *     to which control should be forwarded after switching.</li>
 * <li><strong>prefix</strong> - The application prefix (beginning with "/")
 *     of the sub-application to which control should be switched.  Use a
 *     zero-length string for the default sub-application.  The
 *     appropriate <code>ApplicationConfig</code> object will be stored as a
 *     request attribute, so any subsequent logic will assume the new
 *     sub-application.</li>

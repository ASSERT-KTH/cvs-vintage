/**
 * <p>An <strong>Action</strong> that forwards to the context-relative
 * URI specified by the <code>parameter</code> property of our associated
 * <code>ActionMapping</code>.  This can be used to integrate Struts with
 * other business logic components that are implemented as servlets (or JSP
 * pages), but still take advantage of the Struts controller servlet's
 * functionality (such as processing of form beans).</p>
 *
 * <p>To configure the use of this Action in your
 * <code>struts-config.xml</code> file, create an entry like this:</p>
 *
 * <code>
 *   &lt;action path="/saveSubscription"
 *           type="org.apache.struts.actions.ForwardAction"
 *           name="subscriptionForm"
 *          scope="request"
 *          input="/subscription.jsp"
 *      parameter="/path/to/processing/servlet"/&gt;
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>which will forward control to the context-relative URI specified by the
 * <code>parameter</code> attribute.</p>

/**
 * <p>An abstract <strong>Action</strong> that dispatches to a public
 * method that is named by the <code>parameter</code> attribute of 
 * the corresponding ActionMapping.  This is useful for developers who prefer
 * to combine many related actions into a single Action class.</p>
 *
 * <p>To configure the use of this action in your
 * <code>struts-config.xml</code> file, create an entry like this:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *   &lt;action path="/saveSubscription"
 *           type="org.example.SubscriptionAction"
 *           name="subscriptionForm"
 *          scope="request"
 *          input="/subscription.jsp"
 *      parameter="method"/&gt;
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>where 'method' is the name of a method in your subclass of
 * MappingDispatchAction that has the same signature (other than method
 * name) of the standard Action.execute method.  For example, you might combine
 * the methods for managing a subscription into a  single 
 * MappingDispatchAction class using the following methods:</p> 
 * <ul>
 * <li>public ActionForward create(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form,
 *     HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 *     throws Exception</li>
 * <li>public ActionForward edit(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form,
 *     HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 *     throws Exception</li>
 * <li>public ActionForward save(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form,
 *     HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 *     throws Exception</li>
 * <li>public ActionForward delete(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form,
 *     HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 *     throws Exception</li>
 * <li>public ActionForward list(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form,
 *     HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 *     throws Exception</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>for which you would create corresponding &lt;action&gt; configurations 
 * that reference this class:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *  &lt;action path="/createSubscription" 
 *          type="org.example.SubscriptionAction"
 *          parameter="create"&gt;
 *      &lt;forward name="success" path="/editSubscription.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 * 
 *  &lt;action path="/editSubscription" 
 *          type="org.example.Subscription"
 *          parameter="edit"&gt;
 *      &lt;forward name="success" path="/editSubscription.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 *
 *  &lt;action path="/saveSubscription" 
 *          type="org.example.SubscriptionAction" 
 *          parameter="save"
 *          name="subscriptionForm" 
 *          validate="true" 
 *          input="/editSubscription.jsp" 
 *          scope="request"&gt;
 *      &lt;forward name="success" path="/savedSubscription.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 *
 *  &lt;action path="/deleteSubscription" 
 *          type="org.example.SubscriptionAction"
 *          name="subscriptionForm"
 *          scope="request"
 *          input="/subscription.jsp"
 *          parameter="delete"&gt;
 *      &lt;forward name="success" path="/deletedSubscription.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 *
 *  &lt;action path="/listSubscriptions" 
 *          type="org.example.SubscriptionAction"
 *          parameter="list"&gt;
 *      &lt;forward name="success" path="/subscriptionList.jsp"/&gt;
 *  &lt;/action&gt;
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Unlike DispatchAction, mapping characteristics 
 * may differ between the various handlers, so you can combine actions in the 
 * same class that, for example, differ in their use of forms or validation. 
 * Also, a request parameter, which would be visible to the application user,
 * is not required to enable selection of the handler method.

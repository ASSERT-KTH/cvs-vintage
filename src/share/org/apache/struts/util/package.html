<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Struts Utilities Package offers several families
of classes that assist in solving commonly encountered problems when building
web applications.  Most of the classes in this package do not rely on the
controller servlet framework, or the custom tag libraries, so they are also
suitable for general Java application programming.  The following families
are included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#doc.Beans">Beans and Properties</a> - A family of utility
    classes for manipulating JavaBeans, as well as getting and setting
    properties, without hard coding the names or data types of the
    property getter and setter methods.</li>
<li><a href="#doc.JDBC">JDBC Connection Pool</a> - A very simple connection
    pool that can be utilized in web applications or other environments that
    need to share a limited number of JDBC Connections across a much larger
    number of active users.</li>
<li><a href="#doc.Messages">Message Resources</a> - A family of classes that
    features access to internationalized message strings based on a message
    key coupled with a <code>java.util.Locale</code> object representing a
    particular user's preferred language.</li>
</ul>

/**
 * <p>
 * This interface defines an <strong>optional</strong> PlugIn init(ActionServlet, ModuleConfig) method.
 * It is used <strong>in addition to</strong> the
 * <code>Plugin</code> interface and <strong>does not</strong> replace it!
 * It allows <code>PlugIn</code> developers to implement this new interface
 * as they have time. During initialization, if the <code>PlugInPatch</code>
 * interface is implemented then its' <code>init()</code> method will be called.
 * If only the <code>PlugIn</code> interface is implemented
 * then its' <code>init()</code> method will be called.
 * Sometime after the official 1.1 release of struts the
 * <code>init(ActionServlet, ModuleConfig)</code>  method will be incorporated
 * into the <code>PlugIn</code> interface. At which time the <code>PlugInPatch</code>
 * interface will have its'<code>init()</code>  method removed. </p>
 * <p>See the Validator and
 * Tiles Plugin for an example, conversion time should be
 * <strong>2</strong> minutes or less.

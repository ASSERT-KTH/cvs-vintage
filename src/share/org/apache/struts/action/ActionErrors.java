/**
 * <p>A class that encapsulates the error messages being reported by
 * the <code>validate()</code> method of an <code>ActionForm</code>.
 * Validation errors are either global to the entire <code>ActionForm</code>
 * bean they are associated with, or they are specific to a particular
 * bean property (and, therefore, a particular input field on the corresponding
 * form).</p>
 *
 * <p>Each individual error is described by an <code>ActionError</code>
 * object, which contains a message key (to be looked up in an appropriate
 * message resources database), and up to four placeholder arguments used for
 * parametric substitution in the resulting message.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</strong> - It is assumed that these objects
 * are created and manipulated only within the context of a single thread.
 * Therefore, no synchronization is required for access to internal
 * collections.</p>

/**
 * <p>A <strong>PlugIn</strong> is a configuration wrapper for a
 * module-specific resource or service that needs to be notified about
 * application startup and application shutdown events (corresponding to when
 * the container calls <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> on the
 * corresponding {@link ActionServlet} instance).  PlugIn Actions can be
 * configured in the <code>struts-config.xml</code> file, without the need
 * to subclass {@link ActionServlet} simply to perform application lifecycle
 * activities.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface must supply a zero-argument constructor
 * for use by {@link ActionServlet}.  Configuration can be accomplished by
 * providing standard JavaBeans property setter methods, which will all have
 * been called before the <code>init()</code> method is invoked.</p>

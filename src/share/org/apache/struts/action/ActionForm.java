/**
 * <p>An <strong>ActionForm</strong> is a JavaBean optionally associated with
 * one or more <code>ActionMappings</code>. Such a bean will have had its
 * properties initialized from the corresponding request parameters before
 * the corresponding <code>Action.execute</code> method is called.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the properties of this bean have been populated, but before the
 * <code>execute</code> method of the <code>Action</code> is called, this bean's
 * <code>validate</code> method will be called, which gives the bean a chance
 * to verify that the properties submitted by the user are correct and valid.
 * If this method finds problems, it returns an error messages object that
 * encapsulates those problems, and the controller servlet will return control
 * to the corresponding input form. Otherwise, the <code>validate</code>
 * method returns <code>null</code>, indicating that everything is acceptable
 * and the corresponding <code>Action.execute</code> method should be
 * called.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class must be subclassed in order to be instantiated. Subclasses
 * should provide property getter and setter methods for all of the bean
 * properties they wish to expose, plus override any of the public or
 * protected methods for which they wish to provide modified functionality.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Because ActionForms are JavaBeans, subclasses should also implement
 * <code>Serializable</code>, as required by the JavaBean specification.
 * Some containers require that an object meet all JavaBean requirements
 * in order to use the introspection API upon which ActionForms rely.</p>

     * properties, if any, are reset. As mentioned, session-scope checkboxes
     * must be reset to false for any page where this property is set. This is
     * because the client does not submit a checkbox value when it is clear (false).
     * If a session-scoped checkbox is not proactively reset, it can never be set
     * to false.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method is <strong>not</strong> the appropriate place to initialize
     * form value for an "update" type page (this should be done in a setup Action).
     * You mainly need to worry about setting checkbox values to false; most of the
     * time you can leave this method unimplemented.

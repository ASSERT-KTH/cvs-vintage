/**
 * An <strong>Action</strong> is an adapter between the contents of an incoming
 * HTTP request and the corresponding business logic that should be executed to
 * process this request.  The controller (ActionServlet) will select an
 * appropriate Action for each request, create an instance (if necessary),
 * and call the <code>perform</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Actions must be programmed in a thread-safe manner, because the controller
 * will share the same instance for multiple simultaneous requests.  In
 * this means you should design with the following items in mind:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Instance and static variables MUST NOT be used to store information
 *     related to the state of a particular request.  They MAY be used to
 *     share global resources across requests for the same action.
 * <li>Access to other resources (JavaBeans, session variables, etc.) MUST
 *     be synchronized if those resources require protection.  (Generally,
 *     however, resource classes should be designed to provide their own
 *     protection where necessary.
 * </ul>

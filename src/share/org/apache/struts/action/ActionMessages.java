/**
 * <p>A class that encapsulates messages.  Messages can be either global 
 * or they are specific to a particular bean property.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each individual message is described by an <code>ActionMessage</code>
 * object, which contains a message key (to be looked up in an appropriate
 * message resources database), and up to four placeholder arguments used for
 * parametric substitution in the resulting message.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</strong> - It is assumed that these objects
 * are created and manipulated only within the context of a single thread.
 * Therefore, no synchronization is required for access to internal
 * collections.</p>

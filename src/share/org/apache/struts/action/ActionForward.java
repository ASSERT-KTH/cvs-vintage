/**
 * An <strong>ActionForward</strong> represents a destination to which the
 * controller servlet, <code>ActionServlet</code>, might be directed to
 * perform a <code>RequestDispatcher.forward()</code> or
 * <code>HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()</code> to, as a result of
 * processing activities of an <code>Action</code> class.  Instances of this
 * class may be created dynamically as necessary, or configured in association
 * with an <code>ActionMapping</code> instance for named lookup of potentially
 * multiple destinations for a particular mapping instance.
 * <p>
 * An <code>ActionForward</code> has the following minimal set of properties.
 * Additional properties can be provided as needed by subclassses.
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>name</strong> - Logical name by which this instance may be
 *     looked up in relationship to a particular <code>ActionMapping</code>.
 * <li><strong>path</strong> - Context-relative URI to which control should
 *     be forwarded, or an absolute or relative URI to which control should
 *     be redirected.
 * <li><strong>redirect</strong> - Set to <code>true</code> if the controller
 *     servlet should call <code>HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()</code>
 *     on the associated path; otherwise <code>false</code>.  [false]
 * </ul>

import org.apache.struts.config.ForwardConfig;


/**
 * An <strong>ActionForward</strong> represents a destination to which the
 * controller servlet, <code>ActionServlet</code>, might be directed to
 * perform a <code>RequestDispatcher.forward()</code> or
 * <code>HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()</code> to, as a result of
 * processing activities of an <code>Action</code> class.  Instances of this
 * class may be created dynamically as necessary, or configured in association
 * with an <code>ActionMapping</code> instance for named lookup of potentially
 * multiple destinations for a particular mapping instance.
 * <p>
 * An <code>ActionForward</code> has the following minimal set of properties.
 * Additional properties can be provided as needed by subclassses.
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>contextRelative</strong> - Should the <code>path</code>
 *     value be interpreted as context-relative (instead of
 *     module-relative, if it starts with a '/' character? [false]</li>
 * <li><strong>name</strong> - Logical name by which this instance may be
 *     looked up in relationship to a particular <code>ActionMapping</code>.
 *     </li>
 * <li><strong>path</strong> - Module-relative or context-relative URI to
 *     which control should be forwarded, or an absolute or relative URI to
 *     which control should be redirected.</li>
 * <li><strong>redirect</strong> - Set to <code>true</code> if the controller
 *     servlet should call <code>HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()</code>
 *     on the associated path; otherwise <code>false</code>.  [false]</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Since Struts 1.1 this class extends <code>ForwardConfig</code>
 * and inherits the <code>contextRelative</code> property.
 *
 * <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - This class would have been deprecated and
 * replaced by <code>org.apache.struts.config.ForwardConfig</code> except
 * for the fact that it is part of the public API that existing applications
 * are using.</p>

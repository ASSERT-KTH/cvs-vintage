/**
 * An <strong>ActionMapping</strong> represents the information that the
 * controller servlet, <code>ActionServlet</code>, knows about the mapping
 * of a particular request to an instance of a particular action class.
 * The mapping is passed to the <code>perform()</code> method of the action
 * class itself, enabling access to this information directly.
 * <p>
 * An <code>ActionMapping</code> has the following minimal set of properties.
 * Additional properties can be added by an implementation, simply by
 * providing appropriate public "getter" and "setter" methods.
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>actionClass</strong> - Fully qualified Java class name of the
 *     <code>Action</code> implementation class used by this mapping.  This
 *     property is required.
 * <li><strong>formAttribute</strong> - Name of the session attribute under
 *     which an <code>ActionForm</code> bean is created and/or updated for
 *     this mapping.  If not present, no <code>ActionForm</code> bean will
 *     be maintained automatically.
 * <li><strong>formClass</strong> - Fully qualified Java class name of the
 *     <code>ActionForm</code> implementation class used by this mapping
 *     (if any).
 * <li><strong>formPrefix</strong> - Prefix used to match request parameter
 *     names when populating the properties of our <code>ActionForm</code>
 *     bean (if any).
 * <li><strong>formScope</strong> - Scope within which the form bean associated
 *     with this mapping will be created or looked for.  Valid values are
 *     "request" or "session".
 * <li><strong>formSuffix</strong> - Suffix used to match request parameter
 *     names when populating the properties of our <code>ActionForm</code>
 *     bean (if any).
 * <li><strong>path</strong> - Request URI path used to select this mapping.
 *     If extension mapping is used for the controller servlet, the extension
 *     will be stripped before comparisions against this value are made.
 *     This parameter is required.
 * </ul>

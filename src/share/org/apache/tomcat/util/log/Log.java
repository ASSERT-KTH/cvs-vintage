/**
 * This is the main class seen by objects that need to log. 
 * 
 * It has a log channel to write to; if it can't find a log with that name,
 * it outputs to the default
 * sink.  Also prepends a descriptive name to each message
 * (usually the toString() of the calling object), so it's easier
 * to identify the source.<p>
 *
 * Intended for use by client classes to make it easy to do
 * reliable, consistent logging behavior, even if you don't
 * necessarily have a context, or if you haven't registered any
 * log files yet, or if you're in a non-Tomcat application.
 * <p>
 * Usage: <pre>
 * class Foo {
 *   Log log = Log.getLog("tc_log", "Foo"); // or...
 *   Log log = Log.getLog("tc_log", this); // fills in "Foo" for you
 *   ...
 *     log.log("Something happened");
 *     ...
 *     log.log("Starting something", Log.DEBUG);
 *     ...
 *     catch (IOException e) {
 *       log.log("While doing something", e);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 *  As a special feature ( required in tomcat operation ) the
 *  Log can be modified at run-time, by changing and configuring the logging
 *  implementation ( without requiring any special change in the user code ).
 *  That means that the  user can do a Log.getLog() at any time,
 *  even before the logging system is fully configured. The
 *  embeding application can then set up or change the logging details,
 *  without any action from the log user.
 *
 * @deprecated Commons-logging should be used instead.

    /** Security notes:

    Log acts as a facade to an actual logger ( which has setters, etc).
    
    The "manager" ( embeding application ) can set the handler, and
    edit/modify all the properties at run time.

    Applications can log if they get a Log instance. From Log there is
    no way to get an instance of the LogHandler or LogManager.

    LogManager controls access to the Log channels - a 1.2 implementation
    would check for LogPermissions ( or other mechanisms - like
    information about the current thread, etc ) to determine if the
    code can get a Log.
    
    The "managing application" ( tomcat for example ) can control
    any aspect of the logging and change the actual logging
    implementation behind the scenes.

    One typical usage is that various components will use Log.getLog()
    at various moments. The "manager" ( tomcat ) will initialize the
    logging system by setting a LogManager implementation ( which
    can't be changed by user code after that ). It can then set the
    actual implementation of the logger at any time. ( or provide
    access to trusted code to it ).

    Please review.

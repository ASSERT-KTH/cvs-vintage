Interceptors that are used to connect with a web server, including the standalone http implementation.

<h2>Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Refactor HTTP, AJP12, AJP13 so that the protocol implementation
 ( parsing, constants, etc) are separated from the Interceptor. 
This will implement the design patterns used in interceptors and
simplify portability.

</ul>

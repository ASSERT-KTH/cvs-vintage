<dt>Facades
<dd>For every object exposed in the servlet specification tomcat use a 
Facade. It have few important advantages:
<ul>
<li>Security - the user should have no way to access the real implementation
objects, except one controled way ( HttpRequestFacade.getRealRequest() ).
When policy-based security will be added that will allow the user to declare a 
"trusted" servlet, and no other servlet will be able to access internal objects.
<li>Future evolution of Servlet API - the API changed and will probably change, 
by adding new methods and new semantics. Facades makes very simple to make sure
we respect the spec, without having to change the core too much.
That may allow supporting multiple servlet API versions ( but it's not a goal -
each context has it's own classloader and it may be possible to load a different
JDK and set of facades ).
<li>Decouple the API and the web server. Tomcat.core allows integration with
web servers, and it's  modeled after APIs like Apache's, ISAPI and NSAPI.
</ul>

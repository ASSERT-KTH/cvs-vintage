 *
 *  You can extend this class and implement a number of hooks. The
 *  interceptor is added to a Container ( that represents a group of
 *  URLs where the interceptor will operate ) and the methods that
 *  are re-defined in the subclass are detected ( using introspection )
 *  and used to select the chains where the intercepptor is interested
 *  to participate.
 *
 *  It is possible to define new chains by adding a new method to this
 *  class. The caller ( "chain user" ) will determine the behavior in
 *  case of error and "call all" or "call until [condition]" rules.
 *
 *  Interceptors are the main extension mechanism for tomcat. They have full

/**
 * The correct name for this class should be URLClassLoader.
 * But there is already a class by that name in JDK1.2.
 *
 * I have had quite a few problems with URLClassLoader in
 * past, so I ended up writing this ClassLoader. I found that
 * the Java 2's URLClassLoader, does not close the Jar file once
 * opened. It is a pretty good optimization step, but if you
 * modify the class in the jar file, it does not pick it up. Some
 * operating systems may not let you modify the jar file while it is
 * still open. IMHO, it does make sense to close the jar file
 * after you are done reading the class data. But this approach may not
 * get you the performance of the URLClassLoader, but it works in all
 * cases and also runs on JDK1.1. I have enhanced this class loader
 * to read all the zip/jar entries once & cache the data, so that
 * there is no overhead of opening/closing jar file to pick up
 * each entry.

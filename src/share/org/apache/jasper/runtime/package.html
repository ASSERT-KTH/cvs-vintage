<body>
This package needs to be visible and is used at runtime by the 
generated servlets. 

<h2>Initialization</h2>

Code using jasper-generated servlets must init the runtime by calling:

	JspFactory.setDefaultFactory(new JspFactoryImpl());
	

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

A servlet generated by jasper will depend at runtime on the following:

org.apache.jasper.runtime.* ( act as a facade )
org.apache.jasper.resources.*

org.apache.jasper.Constants
org.apache.jasper.JasperException
org.apache.jasper.Options

Plus general purpose utils - independent of tomcat and self contained:

org.apache.tomcat.util.collections.*
org.apache.tomcat.util.log.*

Things we might want to remove:

util.compat ( only to get platform lineSeparator )

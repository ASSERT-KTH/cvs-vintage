Provides focus management.


<h1>Examples of workflow:</h1>

<h3>Example: Imagine a user selecting <pre>Edit->Copy</pre></h3>
  <p>
  FocusManager checks if a component owns the focus currenlty. This is not
  the case, because the JMenu has the focus. The fall back is to use the
  last available focus owner, which could be a JTextField, etc.
  
  Then FocusManager calls the CopyAction implementation of the JTextField.
  </p>
  
<h3>Example: Imagine a user selects a text in a JTextField and presses Ctrl-C
           to copy the text in the clipboard</h3>
  <p>
  This means the JTextField already has the focus. The KeyListener of the
  JTextField detects that Ctrl-C is pressed. It calls the copyAction of
  FocusManager. FocusManager uses the currently selected Component, which
  is in fact the JTextField and executes its CopyAction.
  </p>
  
<h3>Example: User switches focus between two JTextFields</h3>
  <p>
  The JTextField implements FocusListener (focusList() and focusGained()).
  Both methods call the correspoding methods of FocusManager.
  FocusManager asks the currently selected component, which is a
  FocusOwner implementation, which actions are enabled/disabled and
  notifies the gui to reflect these changes.

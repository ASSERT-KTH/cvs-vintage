/**
 * Mediator is reponsible for managing all the interaction between the
 * components found in a {@link AbstractFrameView}.
 * <p>
 * Following an introduction in the Mediator Pattern:
 * <p>
 * When a program is made up of a number of classes, the logic and computation
 * is divided logically among these classes. However, as more of these isolated
 * classes are developed in a program, the problem of communication between
 * these classes become more complex. The more each class needs to know about
 * the methods of another class, the more tangled the class structure can
 * become. This makes the program harder to read and harder to maintain.
 * Further, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may
 * affect code in several other classes. <bre>The Mediator pattern addresses
 * this problem by promoting looser coupling between these classes. Mediators
 * accomplish this by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of the
 * methods of other classes. Classes send inform the mediator when changes
 * occur and the Mediator passes them on to any other classes that need to be
 * informed.

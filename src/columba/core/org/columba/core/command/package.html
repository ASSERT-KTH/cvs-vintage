Scheduler/Dispatcher for a multi-threaded application.

Columba uses the CommandReference pattern. Where Commands are decoupled
with References. Actions (see org.columba.core.action) start Commands and
pass the appropriate Reference to them.

This is Preclaiming Scheduler implementation. Meaning tasks get queued until 
all resources they need are free at once. Which is no problem, because for 
example a "copy message from folder a to folder b" operation needs only two 
resources: folder a and folder b.

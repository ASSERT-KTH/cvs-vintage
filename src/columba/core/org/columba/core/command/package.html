Scheduler/Dispatcher for a multi-threaded application.

Columba uses the CommandReference pattern. Where Commands are decoupled
with References. Actions (see org.columba.core.action) start Commands and
pass the appropriate Reference to them.

This is Preclaiming Scheduler implementation. Meaning tasks get queued until 
all resources they need are free at once. Which is no problem, because for 
example a "copy message from folder a to folder b" operation needs only two 
resources: folder a and folder b.

The org.columba.core.command.Command class has two methods. The execute-method is for time consuming background tasks, the updateGUI-method is called after the execute-method is finished (the thread is finished). The nice thing about updateGUI() is that is called in the awt-event dispatcher thread. It is therefore thread-safe, and can be used to update the gui.

Note, that execute() has Worker in its signature, which has a couple of methods to display a text in the statusbar, or updating the progressbar.

Worker registers at the taskmanager, which is basically the model for statusbar. We use an easy listener pattern to register all the workers.

This makes it easy for commands to send status updates.

Then we have actions in org.columba.core.action. These provide the glue between the gui-elements and the commands. An action initializes a command and passes it along to the Processor (task scheduler) to execute.

You can find many examples in the packages ending with "action" and "command". Adapting, this schema should be pretty easy for developers.

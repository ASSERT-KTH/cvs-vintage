	Filename: WindowMaximizer.java
	Author: Hrk (Luca Santarelli) <hrk@users.sourceforge.net>
	Comments: this class provides some methods to enlarge or maximise a java.awt.Component object.
	It is needed to provide a true maximisation on Win32 platform, which is not available in pure Java.
	As of today, JDK 1.4.1, blame SUN for not having done this thing themself, since they promised it for JDK 1.3.

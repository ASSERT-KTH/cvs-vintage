Action classes for building menuitems, toolbar buttons, etc. which share the same
action instance
<p>
Almost all actions used in Columba are loaded using the {@link ActionPluginHandler} 
and thereby subclassing {@link FrameAction}.
<p>
You can find the xml-files in the <code>/res</code> directory, in 
org.columba.core.action.action.xml.
Note, that every action plugin has a ID to class mapping in this xml-file.
The ID is used in org.columba.core.action.menu.xml to define the menu.

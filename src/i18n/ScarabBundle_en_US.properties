GroundRules=In order for Scarab to truly be effective (and to keep people like {0} from being constantly in your hair), here are the ground rules...
GroundRules1=1) When you see an issue come through email channels, this is an indication that you have either been assigned or cc'd on a particular issue.  Don't ignore it!
GroundRules2=2) If you are the assignee and have the bandwith, it is your responsibility to investigate the issue and if it has been given a milestone "fix" the issue in the proper order.
GroundRules3=3) If you are the assignee and don't have the bandwidth, it is your responsibility to communicate (through the description field) your inability to complete the assignment.
GroundRules4=4) Don't just go and fix issues that have not been given a milestone.  It is extremely important that we've carefully considered the impact your changes have on the codebase.
GroundRules5=5) Proceed through your issues in order sorted by milestone then priority. If it makes sense to modify the sequence that's fine, just don't blow the milestone!
GroundRules6=6) When an issue is completed (you've written the code, etc.) if applicable check it into cvs and mark the issue "fixed" with a comment on how you did it.  Fixed==Checked In!
GroundRules7=7) Try not to batch up a bunch of issue fixes and check them in all at once. This reeks havoc on our ability to track status and prohibits granular roll backs, etc.
GroundRules8=8) Feel free to add more issues to the list as you realize them.  Scarab MUST reflect all of your changes for our release notes to worth anything.
GroundRules9=9) Post any and all comments/notes around a particular issue to its description field. This way anyone who is handed an issue can easily see its history and get crackin!
GroundRules10=10) Refer to Scarab on an almost constant basis.  In practice you'll find that seeing what is expected of you here beats the hell out of sifting through emails.
GroundRulesEnd=At first this may seem Draconian.  The truth is that this is simply a way for us to track our own to do lists, share our to do's with friends, and keep pesky status mongers out of our hair.  I truly look forward to the day when I come a knockin' and you reply "its in Scarab!"

##Introduction
ScarabIs=Scarab is
IntroP1=a highly configurable issue tracking tool that can be used for all types of projects: technical and non-technical alike. Because all parameters in the system are configurable, this tool meets the needs of the project as well as the individual user. Each implementation can be configured directly to the workflow processes of the project through the definition of issue types and attributes. The user interface is designed to be accessible and constant: once you become familiar with the look and feel you will find new processes quick to master.
ScarabProvides=Scarab provides
IntroP2=a robust set of tools for issue management:
IntroP3Head=Issue entry: 
IntroP3=The issue entry process  is designed to help users create meaningful issues and avoid duplication.   Attributes are used to describe issues and to check the issue database for   similar entries. If any duplicates are found, the user has the opportunity   to review potential duplicates, add comments to like issues or modify their   issue before committing it to the database. 
IntroP4Head=Templates for issue entry :
IntroP4=Frequently entered issue criteria can be saved in templates for speedy entry. Files can be attached to an issue, and are tracked directly with their issue. Users can add and edit comments to issues as needed. Users can access and review the complete issue history while viewing an issue. 
IntroP5Head=Issue query:
IntroP5=Accessing issues in the database is simple using the query feature. Users can easily find, access and modify issues individually or in groups. The Advanced Query feature allows the user to create detailed issue searches, specifying values for multiple attributes and limiting their search to specific date or issue number ranges. The Custom Query feature allows the user to search by text string-the user can specify a set of information to compare against issues in the database. Frequently used queries can be saved and easily run. <!--Once a saved query has been created, the user can request frequent email updates on issues matching the search criteria.-->
IntroP6Head=Reports: 
IntroP6=The robust reports interface allows the user to create and save reports. Reports provide customizable and meaningful metrics.
IntroP7Head=Email notifications: 
IntroP7=As important events occur, email is generated and sent to all parties associated with the event. Alert emails contain links to views of the event.
IntroP8=While Scarab is designed to be an easy to use, intuitive application, should you need additional assistance this help system has been provided. In the help system you will find definitions of Scarab terminology and navigation aid as well as hints for using the application.

## Navigation
EntryForms=Entry forms
ResultsandSelection=Results and selection pages
CustomizingInterface=Customizing the interface
TheScarab=The Scarab 
NavP1=interface is organized to allow access to all major functionality from anywhere in the application. Each of the action screens provides relevant information along with links to access further details as needed. A unified and consistent interface allows you to easily recognize the types of information and actions available on each screen. 
NavP2=Each screen provides the following navigational aids
NavP3Head=The Left navigation bar:
NavP3=The navigation bar is organized by issue type, then by function. To access functionality within a specific issue type, select the title of the issue type on the left navigation bar. The functionality available to that issue type will appear below the title. 
NavP4Head=The Query bar
NavP4=The query   bar provides access to the search tools. Th issue id box allows you   to access a specific issue number. The select query box provides access   to the Advanced and Custom query features. If you have any saved queries,   they will appear in the select query box.
NavP5Head=Section titles
NavP5=Most information screens are organized in tabular format. Each section is presented with an informative section header, describing the section and, often, providing general information about the section. Each column header acts as a link to change the sort order for that table. For the sort column, the title has an arrow indicating the direction of the sort: the default is ascending. To change the direction of the sort click on the arrow.
Buttons=Buttons:
NavP6=indicate a set of actions that can be performed. Often you will find more than one set of buttons on a page. Buttons directly below a section will perform actions on the section only, if you have you may find an 
NavP6S2=Update Options
NavP6S3=button beside an attribute selector in one section. This indicates that if you change the attribute clicking the button will change the options available to that attribute. 
NavP7Head=Checkboxes:
NavP7=used to select list items for modification.
NavP8=In many cases, helpful information is included directly on the screens to clarify unusual operations. Error messages are provided in line to help identify where the error occurred and specific means for remedy.
NavP9Head=Entry forms
NavP9=Entry forms are easy to use. Default data points are indicated with * (astricks) beside the field title. Often you will find textual guidelines within the entry forms to help you through the form entry process.
NavP10=Navigational buttons are available on each screen. These buttons perform actions on the data entered in the form. The 
CancelDesc=cancels the process in which you currently are engaged.
ContinueDesc=button will take you to the next part of the entry process.
DoneDesc=button will save your work and return you to the last process in which you were engaged.
NextDesc=button indicates that there is further information to be gathered on the next screen. Clicking this button will cache your current data and take you to the next part in the wizard.
NavP10Head=Tabs      
NavP10=Some multipart functionality provides tabs for easy navigation between parts. In the reports functionality you can use the tabs to switch from defining row content to the final output characteristics.
NavP11=If you have a saved data set for an entry form (like saved queries or reports, or issue entry templates), the top section contains a drop down list with all such items available for use on this form. This appears in the issue entry, query and reports functionality. To use a saved form select the one of interest from the drop down box and use the 
Selectlc=select
NavP11S2=button to render the selection.
NavP12=Each attribute in an entry form displays all available options, from which you can select one or more. 
NavP13Head=Results and selection pages
NavP13=Results screens appear after you have activated a request, like a query, a report, etc. Each results screen provides a list of items with some descriptive information.
NavP14=Many results screens allow you to perform actions on the items that appear. Under the items you will find a set of buttons linked to actions that can be performed. There may be two sets of buttons. The first set will affect only those items you select using the checkboxes. If a second set appears, they will perform actions on all items in the list.
NavP15=Below the action buttons you may find links to additional actions. These links allow you to affect the layout of results.
NavP16Head=Sort order  
NavP16=Items are initially in ascending order by their id. To sort by an attribute, click the title of the attribute. The sort will change to ascending by that attribute. Clicking the arrow beside the attribute name will provide a descending sort. 
NavP17=Many screens are customizable. You can add to or remove the attributes that appear on your screen by clicking on the add/remove attributes from view link. Use the check boxes to show or hide attributes. Add a check to the items you would like to appear on your screen. Use this screen to determine the order of the columns by using the "Columnar sequence" field.

You can use the tools as a knowledge sharing device and a means of tracking and managing the health of your project.

## ScarabFAQ
FrequentlyAskedQuestions=Frequently asked questions
WhatIssueType=How do I figure out what issue type to use?
WhatIssueTypeAnswer=The issue types available to you in your project have been determined by your project administrator. By accessing the 
WhatIssueTypeAnswer2=Issue Type selection
WhatIssueTypeAnswer3=screen you can see a description of each issue type and select the one that best describes your issue. For more information see the 
WhatIssueTypeAnswer4=discussion.
CanIMoveIssues=Can I move an issue to a different issue type? how about to a different project? 
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer=Issues can be moved between issue types through the issue detail page. For more information see the
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer2=moving issues
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer3=discussion. For a discussion on circumstances in which you may wish to move issues, see the 
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer4=document.
StopDuplicateChecking=How can stop the duplication checking?
StopDuplicateCheckingAnswer=The duplication checking process is set by the project leader. If you feel it is affecting the processing of issues, contact your project administrator.
CanIAddAttributes=How do I add or remove attributes from my screen?
CanIAddAttributesAnswer=Many pages in Scarab are customizable. For more information see the discussion on 
CustomizingTheScreen=customizing the screen.
GlobalAndUserAttributes=What is the difference between a Global attribute and a User attribute?
GlobalAndUserAttributesAnswer=Global attributes are used to define issues. Global attributes are defined at the domain level and made available within issue types by the Project Owner. When creating issues, the values assigned to global attributes become the descriptors for issues. Values associated with global attributes and used to search the database for issues when using queries. You may find Global attributes like "Status", "Description", "Operating System" and the like in your Issue Type.
GlobalAndUserAttributesAnswer2=Once issues are created, User attributes are used to associate users with issues. User attributes are defined at the global level and are associated with a base permission and an email action. Users with the right permission appear in the User attributes drop down menu and can be associted with an issue using that User attribute. The Assigned To attribute is a User attribute.

## UserIssueEntry
Overview=Overview
EnteringIssues=Entering Issues
Composing=Composing effective issues
EnteringAnIssues=Entering an issue
SettingDependecies=Setting dependencies
IssueAttachments=Issue attachments
HandlingDuplicates=Handling duplicates
ReviewDuplicates=Reviewing duplicates
CommentingOn=Commenting on like issues
UsingTemplates=Using templates
IssueEntryP1=Effective issue reports assist in the process of refining projects and reaching the ultimate goal of completion. A useful issue report normally has two qualities:
IssueEntryP2Head=Reproducible.
IssueEntryP2=Issues that cannot be duplicated are generally   marked invalid. Provide detailed instructions for duplicating your issue.
IssueEntryP3Head=Specific
IssueEntryP3=The more details you provide the easier it   is for the engineer to identify the problem and solution.     
IssueEntryP4=For example: you're testing a web browser. You crash at site.com, and want to write up an issue report:
IssueEntryP5=Inappropriate:
IssueEntryP6="My browser crashed. I think I was on site.com. My computer uses Windows. I think that this is a really bad problem and you should fix it now. By the way, I don't like the icons. Nobody will use your software if you keep those ugly icons. Oh, and my grandmother's home page doesn't look right, either, it's all messed up. Good luck." 
IssueEntryP7=More appropriate:
IssueEntryP8="I crashed each time when I went to site.com, using the 10.28.99 build on a Win NT 4.0 (Service Pack 5) system. I also rebooted into Linux, and reproduced this problem using the 10.28.99 Linux build.
IssueEntryP9=It again crashed each time upon drawing the banner at the top of the page. I broke apart the page, and discovered that the following image link will crash the application reproducibly, unless you remove the "border=0" attribute:
IssueEntryP10=<IMG SRC="http://site.com/images/topics/topicfoos.gif" width=34 height=44 border=0 alt="News">
IssueEntryP11Head=Entering an issue
IssueEntryP11=Because of it's highly customizable nature, entering issues in Scarab can be as individual as the person entering the issue. There are some basic principles that apply to all issues being entered in the database: for each issue entered you will define the issue and add supporting information. You may also be able to check the database for duplicates.
IssueEntryP12Head=Defining issues
IssueEntryP12=Each issue type has a unique set of attributes specific to the needs of the issue type. When entering the issue you will want to add values for as many attributes as possible. Remember, when creating effective issues you want to be as specific and detailed as possible. Attributes allow you to add meaningful information that can be easily used for tracking and searching purposes.
IssueEntryP13=While creating the issue, use the textual fields to add as much specific information for the issue. Your administrator may have defined attributes to track specific generic information, but the more details you can add into the text fields the better issue you will have created.
IssueEntryP14Head=Adding supporting information
IssueEntryP14=In the issue entry process you can add additional relevant information; you can include dependencies on other issues as well as attaching appropriate files (like patches, emails, etc.).
IssueEntryP15Head=Setting dependencies: 
IssueEntryP15=Issues often have dependencies on other issues. One issue may require a resolution from another before any work can be done. Two issues may have parallel resolutions and need to be tracked together, though they have no direct influence on one another
IssueEntryP16=There are three levels of dependencies within Scarab: blocking, duplicating and non-blocking. Blocking issues prevent the issue being blocked, from being resolved. The blocking issue must be addressed before the blocked issue can be resolved.
IssueEntryP17=Sometimes duplicate issues may be entered and need to be tracked separately. Marking an issue as a duplicate allows users to track efforts on both issues. Duplicates may be in different modules or the same module.
IssueEntryP18=Marking issues as non-blocking dependencies also allows users to simultaneously track efforts on two or more issues.
IssueEntryP19=You can track the progress of interrelated issues by using the Dependencies section of the issue and clicking on either the issue id or the Issue summary links to the issues. In this area you can also redefine the Dependency type.
IssueEntryP20Head=Issue attachments:
IssueEntryP20S1=Keeping track of information relating to an issue is simplified using the issue attachment feature. You can include email conversations, relevant documentation, patch files, or any other supporting file. If you need to include a url, you can add that into any text field. To add a file, use the
IssueEntryP20S2=section in the 
IssueEntryP20S3=form (if you have duplication active, this will appear after the duplication checking process). To do so, enter a brief description of the attachment and use the browse button to navigate to the file on your local system or enter a path for the file and click the 
IssueEntryP20S4=button. You can repeat this process to add multiple files.
IssueEntryP21Head=Handling Duplicates
IssueEntryP22=If you have duplication checking active, Scarab will use a subset of attributesIssueEntryto check for possible duplicates in the database. If duplicates are found IssueEntrya report of similar issues will be presented with your issue listed at the top. Review the issues listed for fit. You can do a number of things at thisIssueEntrypoint:
IssueEntryP23=Review individual issues by clicking on their id. The full issue descriptionIssueEntry  will appear. 
IssueEntryP24=Sort issues by each of the categories. Click on the name of the category to change the sort order
IssueEntryP25=Alter one or more issues at the same time. Click on the check box to the left of the issue ids that you would like to manipulate. You can then enter a note in the
IssueEntryP25S2=field and click the 
IssueEntryP25S3=button to add a note to the comments section of all issues selected.
IssueEntryP26=Skip this process by clicking on the 
IssueEntryP26S2=button.
IssueEntryP27Head=Reviewing duplicates
IssueEntryP27=For each item in the database that has been identified as a possible duplicate for the criteria you entered, an entry appears in the 
IssueEntryP27S2=Identified as duplicate
IssueEntryP27S3=screen. You can change the sort order by clicking on the title of the column. Each column represents an attribute used in the search for duplicates. 
IssueEntryP28=Each module has a set of assigned attributes. The values entered for each of the attributes is parsed into a search string so that each value becomes a searchable string. Use this page to compare your potential new issue with those in the database. 
IssueEntryP29Head=Commenting on like issues
IssueEntryP29=The note box under the list of like issues allows you to add comments to issues without going to the issue. You may want to comment that you are experiencing similar problems, recommend a solution for a similar issue or add to the information in an attribute. Information entered in the
IssueEntryP29S2=box will be added to the 
IssueEntryP29S3=section in the issue. To add comments, enter text in the
IssueEntryP29S4=box and click the
IssueEntryP29S5=button. Once your entry has been processed a message will appear at the top of the screen letting you know that hat your comment has been added.

## UserIssueModify
ManagingInformation=Managing information
AssociatingUsers=Associating users
MovingIssues=Moving issues
ModifyP1=Once an issue has been created it is ready for assignment or manipulation. You can perform the following functions on issues in the database:
ModifyP2=review, add or edit information about the issue
ModifyP3=associate users 
ModifyP4=move issues
ManagingIssueInfo=Managing issue information
ManagingIssueInfoP1=Almost all attributes of an issue are editable from the view issue screen. You can alter most attribues, if you have the proper permission level, view user associations, add url links, create dependencies, add attachments, and view the issue history.

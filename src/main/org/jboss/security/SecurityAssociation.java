/** The SecurityAssociation class maintains the security principal and
credentials. This can be done on either a singleton basis or a thread
local basis depending on the server property. When the server property has
been set to true, the security information is maintained in thread local
storage. The type of thread local storage depends on the
org.jboss.security.SecurityAssociation.ThreadLocal property.
If this property is true, then the thread local storage object is of
type java.lang.ThreadLocal which results in the current thread's
security information NOT being propagated to child threads.
 
When the property is false or does not exist, the thread local storage object
is of type java.lang.InheritableThreadLocal, and any threads spawned by the
current thread will inherit the security information of the current thread.
Subseqent changes to the current thread's security information are NOT
propagated to any previously spawned child threads.

When the server property is false, security information is maintained in
class variables which makes the information available to all threads within
the current VM.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This package hosts an extension to the J2eeDeployer that is able to
    "virtually" merge J2EE applications in the jboss runtime within a so-called "scope". Scoped 
		applications are able to share classes and resources which allows to remove
		redundancies from your ears/jars (management impact) and introduces additional runtime 
		optimisations (performance impact).
		</p>
		<h2>The Global Scope Deployer </h2>
		<p>
		We provide a default "global scope" deployer that merges all applications in a single
		scope. It comes with an appropriate deployment/undeployment logic that analyses 
		Class-Path annotations in your ears Manifest - Marc: this is not necessary to 
		get the resource sharing effect, but it is useful if deploying mutually dependent ears. 
		The classloading scheme prefers local resources to dispatching to the scope 
		such that you may still have the advantage of including redundant class files.

 * </ol>
 *  <p><b>2001/08/01: marcf</b>
 *  <ol>
 *   <li>Added the schedule method 
 *   <li>The bean lock is now responsible for implementing the locking
 *   policies, it was before in the interceptor code it is now factored
 *   out allowing for pluggable lock policies (optimistic for ex) 
 *   <li>Implemented pessimistic locking and straight spec requirement in the
 *   schedule method would need to factor this in an abstract class for the
 *   BeanLock that extending policies can use
 * </ol>
 *  <p><b>2001/08/02: marcf</b>
 *  <ol>
 *   <li>Did what was said above, moved to an extension based mech with an
 *   abstract base class.
 *   <li>This is the simple lock, won't scale well (imho) but is robust in
 *   normal operation
 *   <li>The class must now implement schedule and the various notification
 *   calls.  EndTransaction wontSynchronize can be radically different (N-Lock)

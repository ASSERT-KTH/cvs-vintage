/**
 * A generic object pool.  You must provide a PoolObjectFactory (or the class

 * many configurable parameters, such as the minimum and maximum size of the
 * pool, whether to enable idle timeouts, etc.  If the pooled objects
 * implement PooledObject, they will automatically be returned to the pool at
 * the appropriate times.
 * <P>In general, the appropriate way to use a pool is:</P>
 * <OL>
 *   <LI>Create it</LI>
 *   <LI>Configure it (set factory, name, parameters, etc.)</LI>
 *   <LI>Initialize it (once done, further configuration is not allowed)</LI>

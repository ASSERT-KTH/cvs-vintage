  </HEAD>
  <BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE">
    <P>Contains classes required for generic object pools.  With these classes,
      you can create pools for any type of objects - all you do is supply the
      object factory.  There are specific object factory implementations for
      JDBC connections in the package <B>org.minerva.factories</B>.</P>
    <P>This documentation links to the J2SE v1.3 documentation on the JavaSoft
      web site, but the classes are compatible with v1.2 as well.</P>

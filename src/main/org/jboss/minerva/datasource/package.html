    <P>Data Sources that are the main client interface for connection pools.
      The quickest way to get up and running with a JDBC or XA connection pool
      is to create and configure a DataSource.  This package includes both
      non-transactional JDBC pools, and transactional JDBC pools that will
      automatically register with a JTA TransactionManager.  You may choose
      to use the wrappers for non-transactional drivers in a transactional
      JDBC pool by using that as your XADataSource (see
      org.minerva.xa.XADataSourceImpl).</P>

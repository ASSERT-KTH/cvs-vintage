    <P>Transactional wrappers for JDBC drivers that don't implement the JDBC
      2.0 standard extension.  This allows an "old" JDBC driver to participate
      in a two-phase commit environment, though with certain limitations.  For
      example, you cannot use one transaction across multiple connections, and
      there will be heuristic failures if commits or rollbacks fail under
      certain circumstances.  This wrapper also allows connections to
      participate in JTA transactions, so a J2EE server can manage them
      appropriately.  Highly recommended for use in a J2EE server (as opposed
      to using the non-conformant connections directly).</P>

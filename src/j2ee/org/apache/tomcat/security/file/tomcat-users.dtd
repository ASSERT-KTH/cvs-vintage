<!-- The "tomcat-users" element contains all of the defined users and groups
     within a specific security domain (realm), as well as the roles assigned
     to those users and groups.  In addition, a role that contains the special
     sub-element "anyone" is implicitly assigned to all defined users.  -->

<!ELEMENT tomcat-users (user|group|role)+>

<!-- The "user" element represents an individual person that is allowed access
     to application components protected via this security domain (realm),
     once they establish their identity by presenting a correct password.

     The "name" attribute is an identifier that will be presented to select
     a particular user.  It must be unique within a given security domain
     (realm).  -->

     The "password" attribute contains the result of calculating an SHA
     MessageDigest on the cleartext password, and representing each byte
     of the result as a two-digit hexadecimal number.  -->

<!-- The "group" element represents a named group of users, or contains the
     special sub-element "anyone" that declares all named users to be members
     of this group.

     XXX This DTD does not groups as members of other groups.  This can be
     accomplished by adding group-member as a valid sub-element, and adjusting
     the implementation to correctly represent these semantics.

     a particular group.  It must be unique within a given security domain

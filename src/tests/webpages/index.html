<title>Sanity Test Base Page</title>

<body>

This is the home page of the self test hierarchy. 

<h2>Running the tests from the web</h2>

You first need to enable the /admin application. You'll need that for other 
purposes as well. 

<p>Edit TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml  and replace:

<br>
 &lt;Context path="/admin" 
          docBase="webapps/admin" 
          debug="0" 
          reloadable="true" 
          <b>trusted="false"</b> &gt;
<br>

With:

<br>
 &lt; Context path="/admin" 
          docBase="webapps/admin" 
          debug="0" 
          reloadable="true" 
          <b>trusted="true"</b> &gt; 
<p>

You'll also need to edit TOMCAT_HOME/conf/users/admin-users.xml and 
change the password ( very important for security reasons ).

<p>

After that you can just go to 
<a href="/admin/test/test.jsp" >/admin/test/test.jsp</a> and you'll see
the test results. 

<p>You can run only subsets of the tests:
<ul>
<li>soon, I need to finish test.jsp first to see what param I'll use :-)
</ul>

<h2>Automated ( script based ) run</h2>

There are 2 ways to run the sanity checks in a nightly or automated way.

<p>
The easiest is to use a bit of "sed" magic to make /admin "trusted", then
start the server and use "wget" or "htget" or any equivalent program 
( I'll include a java one soon ) to get the /admin/test/test.jsp page.

<p>
The alternate solution is to run the scripts provided in 
TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/test/WEB-INF/scripts ( instructions will be added soon
if anyone asks )

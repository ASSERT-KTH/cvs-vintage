<!--
Here is what I was thinking the direction of the XML data format should
look like. Of course it is far from 100% complete, but it does show a
few certain things that I would like to achieve. Namely:

#1. Database independence
#2. XML attributes are only used for ID values for certain key fields
that are required to already exist in the database before being created.
For example, I give id's for the module as well as the users. In the
case of the module information, I actually also include it.
#3. I put things within tags instead of as XML attributes because they
could contain CDATA. This will allow those tags to contain that type of
information.
#4. The idea is that someone should be able to also (optionally) create
a new scarab database with only user and module information
pre-populated and be able to import an XML file and have it fill in the
rest of the information as necessary.
#5. The XML format should be able to be parsed by a human. In the
future, we may support XML submissions via email. This would make it
easier to work with.

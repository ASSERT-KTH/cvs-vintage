<!--
    The Scarab xml import works by parsing the XML file and
    replaying the activityset/activity elements. The last 
    activityset/activity elements in the issue element is the
    current state of the issue. Therefore, the order of the
    ActivitySet/activity elements in the issue is very important.

            The ActivitySet needs to have a unique id in the file.

            The activity-set id passed is checked against the db to see if
            this activity-set already exists (The activity-set id 
            == SCARAB_TRANSACTION.TRANSACTION_ID).  If the activity-set id
            does not refer to an already-existing activity-set, a new
            activity-set id is created by taking the next id off the top of 
            auto-incrementing sequence; the passed activity-set id is
            discarded.  If an activity-set w/ the passed id already exists,
            then we'll use the already-existing activity-set during import of 
            this activity-set's activites. To avoid picking up an extant
            activity-set unintentionally on import, i.e. in the case where
            you are doing an import of all new issues w/ no desire to refer
            to already existing activity-sets, do not use a purely numerical
            id for your activity-set id: Give the activity-set an alphabetic 
            prefix.  In other words, instead of using numeric ids like 
            1,2,3,4,5, use ids that run new1, new2, new3, etc.

            If you are creating an ActivitySet with a dependency in it,
            then there should be duplicate ActivitySet's in both issues.
            They should have the same id value. The only difference is
            the activity id should be unique between the two.

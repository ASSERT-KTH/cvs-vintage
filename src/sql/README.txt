The files in this directory are for dealing with the RDBMS. There are
scripts for helping with creation and importing the database. There is
also required and default data for configuring Scarab.

Currently, our focus is on supporting MySQL. However, Scarab should be
able to work with nearly any RDBMS available and we will require that
the community help provide support for any other databases. For example,
we have started documentation on how to configure Scarab to generate
files for use with other databasse. This file is available on our website:

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/project_docs.html>

If you have questions or comments please subscribe to the Scarab mailing list
and ask there. <http://scarab.tigris.org/>

Thanks

-The Scarab Team

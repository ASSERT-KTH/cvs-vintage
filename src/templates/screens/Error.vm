  <h3>Stack Trace</h3>

<pre>
If the stack trace below has at the top a mention of
"ResourceNotFoundException", that means that a template could not be
found (404) and is probably the result of a broken link.

If the stack trace has something else, please enter a copy of the stack
trace <strong>and an explanation of what you did to cause it</strong> to the 
<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues.html">Issue Tracking System</a> for analysis. If you are a developer and think you 
know what the problem is, feel free to send in a patch to fix the
problem.
</pre>

  <p>
Sorry, there was no error message. :-( If there was one, it would have been
shown here. Please believe me!
 </p>
 <p>
  Although, one common source of the error could be a result of not being able
  to find the requested template. Please try going back to the
  $link.setPage("Start.vm").setLabel("Start") screen and starting over.

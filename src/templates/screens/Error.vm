Sorry, there was no error message. :-( If there was one, it would have been 
shown here. Please believe me!

  Although, one common source of the error could be a result of not being able 
  to find the requested template. Please try going back to the 
  <a href="$link.setPage("Start.vm")">Start</a> screen and starting over.

This is going to be the homepage that you first get to when you bring up
Scarab. In some installations, this will be the Login page and in
others, you can have it bring up this page. For now, we just have a link
to our Links.vm page (below) which is a list of the currently
implemented (and under construction) pages for the application. If you
have questions or comments, please read
<a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/project_members.html">this page</a>.

  <h3><strong><a name="top" id="top">Introduction to Scarab</a></strong></h3>
  <p> Scarab is a highly configurable issue tracking tool that can be used for 
    all types of projects: technical and non-technical alike. Because all parameters 
    in the system are configurable, Scarab meets the needs of the project as well 
    as the individual user. Each Scarab implementation can be configured directly 
    to the workflow processes of the project through the definition of issue types 
    and attributes. The user interface is designed to be accessible and constant: 
    once you become familiar with the Scarab look and feel you will find 
    new processes quick to master.</p>
  <p>Scarab provides a robust set of tools for issue management:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    <strong>Issue entry: </strong>The issue entry process 
      of Scarab is designed to help users create meaningful issues and avoid duplication. 
      Attributes are used to describe issues and to check the issue database for 
      similar entries. If any duplicates are found, the user has the opportunity 
      to review potential duplicates, add comments to like issues or modify their 
      issue before committing it to the database. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>Templates for issue entry : </strong>Frequently entered issue criteria 
    can be saved in templates for speedy entry. Files can be attached to an issue, 
    and are tracked directly with their issue. Users can add and edit comments 
    to issues as needed. Users can access and review the complete issue history 
    while viewing an issue. </li>
  <li><strong>Issue query: </strong>Accessing issues in the database is simple using the 
    query feature. Users can easily find, access and modify issues individually 
    or in groups. The Advanced Query feature allows the user to create detailed 
    issue searches, specifying values for multiple attributes and limiting their 
    search to specific date or issue number ranges. The Custom Query feature allows 
    the user to search by text string-the user can specify a set of information 
    to compare against issues in the database. Frequently used queries can be 
    saved and easily run. <!--Once a saved query has been created, the user can request 
    frequent email updates on issues matching the search criteria.--></li>
  <li><strong>Reports: </strong>The robust reports interface allows the user to create and 
    save reports. Reports provide customizable and meaningful metrics. </li>
  <li><strong>Email notifications: </strong>As important events occur, email is generated 
    and sent to all parties associated with the event. Alert emails contain links 
    to views of the event.</li>
</ul>

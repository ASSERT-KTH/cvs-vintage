<h3>Duplicates</h3>
<p>The values you entered for attributes while entering your new issue are used 
  to check for duplicates with anything stored in the database. The values are 
  combined into one criteria and a search of the database is performed. If one 
  or more possible duplicates are found you will be given the opportunity to </p>
<ul>
  <li>review possible duplicates</li>
  <li>vote on duplicate issues</li>
  <li>comment on like issues</li>
  <li>by-pass the duplicate checking process and continue with entering your issue</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Reviewing duplicates</b></p>

<p>For each item in the database that has been identified as a possible duplicate 
  for the criteria you entered, an entry appears in the <b>Identified as duplicate</b> 
  screen. You can change the sort order by clicking on the title of the column. 
  Each column represents an attribute used in the search for duplicates. </p>
<p>Each module has a set of assigned attributes. The values entered for each of 
  the attributes is parsed into a search string so that each value becomes a searchable 
  string. Use this page to compare your potential new issue with those in the 
  database. </p>
<p><b>Voting on duplicate issues</b></p>
<p>To cast a vote on an issue using this page, select the issue using the radio 
  buttons to the left of the issue and click on the <i>Add vote to selected</i>. 
  Once your vote has been processed the screen will refresh and a message will 
  appear at the top of the screen indicating the result of the submission. </p>
<p>You can add a comment to the issue at the same time you vote by entering text 
  in the <i>Note</i> box and clicking the <i>Add vote to selected</i> button.</p>
<p><b>Commenting on like issues</b></p>
<p>The note box under the list of like issues allows you to add comments to issues 
  without going to the issue. You may want to comment that you are experiencing 
  similar problems, recommend a solution for a similar issue or add to the information 
  in an attribute. Information entered in the <i>Notes</i> box will be added to 
  the <i>Comments</i> section in the issue. To add comments, enter text in the 
  <i>Note</i> box and click the <i>Submit note</i> button. Once your entry has 
  been processed a message will appear at the top of the screen letting you know 
  that hat your comment has been added.</p>

  <h3> <a name="top" id="top">Navigating Scarab</a></h3>
  <p>The Scarab interface is organized to allow access to all major functionality 
    from anywhere in the application. Each of the action screens provides relevant 
    information along with links to access further details as needed. A unified 
    and consistent interface allows you to easily recognize the types of information 
    and actions available on each screen. </p>
  <p>Each screen provides the following navigational aids</p>
  
<ul>
  <li> <strong>The Left navigation bar</strong>: The left navigation bar is organized 
    by issue type, then by function. To access functionality within a specific 
    issue type, select the title of the issue type on the left navigation bar. 
    The functionality available to that issue type will appear below the title. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <strong>The Query bar</strong>: The query 
      bar provides access to Scarab's search tools. Th issue id box allows you 
      to access a specific issue number. The select query box provides access 
      to the Advanced and Custom query features. If you have any saved queries, 
      they will appear in the select query box.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Section titles</strong>: Most information screens are organized 
    in tabular format. Each section is presented with an informative section header, 
    describing the section and, often, providing general information about the 
    section. Each column header acts as a link to change the sort order for that 
    table. For the sort column, the title has an arrow indicating the direction 
    of the sort: the default is ascending. To change the direction of the sort 
    click on the arrow. </li>
  <li> <strong>Buttons:</strong> indicate a set of actions that can be performed. 
    Often you will find more than one set of buttons on a page. Buttons directly 
    below a section will perform actions on the section only, if you have you 
    may find an <strong>Update Options </strong> button beside an attribute selector 
    in one section. This indicates that if you change the attribute clicking the 
    button will change the options available to that attribute. </li>
  <li><strong>Checkboxes:</strong> used to select list items for modification.</li>
</ul>
 In many cases, helpful information is included 
  directly on the screens to clarify unusual operations. Error messages are provided 
  in line to help identify where the error occurred and specific means for remedy. 
  <h3><a name="forms" id="forms">Entry forms</a></h3>
  <p>Entry forms are easy to use. Default data points are indicated with * (astricks) 
    beside the field title. Often you will find textual guidelines within the 
    entry forms to help you through the form entry process.</p>
  <p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>
  <p>Above and below the form appear a set of buttons. These buttons perform actions 
    on the data entered in the form. The </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Cancel</strong> cancels the process in which you currently are engaged. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Continue</strong> button will take you to the next part of the entry process. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Done</strong>button will save your work and return you to the last process in which you were engaged. </li>
    <li><strong>Next</strong> button indicates that there is further information to be gathered 
      on the next screen. Clicking this button will cache your current data and 
      take you to the next part in the wizard.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tabs</strong></p>
  <p>Some multipart functionality provides tabs for easy navigation between parts. 
    In the reports functionality you can use the tabs to switch from defining 
    row content to the final output characteristics.</p>
  <p>If you have a saved data set for an entry form (like saved queries or reports, 
    or issue entry templates), the top section contains a drop down list with 
    all such items available for use on this form. This appears in the issue entry, 
    query and reports functionality. To use a saved form select the one of interest 
    from the drop down box and use the <strong>select</strong> button to render the selection.</p>
  <p>Each attribute in an entry form displays all available options, from which 
    you can select one or more. </p>
  <h3><a name="results" id="results">Results and selection pages</a></h3>
  <p>Results screens appear after you have activated a request, like a query, 
    a report, etc. Each results screen provides a list of items with some descriptive 
    information.</p>
  <p>Many results screens allow you to perform actions on the items that appear. 
    Under the items you will find a set of buttons linked to actions that can 
    be performed. There may be two sets of buttons. The first set will affect 
    only those items you select using the checkboxes. If a second set appears, 
    they will perform actions on all items in the list.</p>
  <p>Below the action buttons you may find links to additional actions. These 
    links allow you to affect the layout of results.</p>
  <p><strong>Sort order</strong></p>
  <p>Items are initially in ascending order by their id. To sort by an attribute, 
    click the title of the attribute. The sort will change to ascending by that 
    attribute. Clicking the arrow beside the attribute name will provide a descending 
    sort. </p>
  <h3><a name="customizing" id="customizing">Customizing the interface</a></h3>
  <p>Many screens are customizable. You can add to or remove the attributes that 
    appear on your screen by clicking on the <em>add/remove attributes from view</em> 
    link. Use the check boxes to show or hide attributes. Add a check to the items 
    you would like to appear on your screen. Use this screen to determine the 
    order of the columns by using the &quot;Columnar sequence&quot; field.</p>

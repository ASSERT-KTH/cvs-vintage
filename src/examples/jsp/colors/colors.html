This web page is an example using JSP and BEANs. 
<p>
Guess my favorite two colors 

<p> If you fail to guess both of them - you get yellow on red.

<p> If you guess one of them right, either your foreground or 
    your background will change to the color that was guessed right.

<p> Guess them both right and your browser foreground/background 
    will change to my two favorite colors to display this page.

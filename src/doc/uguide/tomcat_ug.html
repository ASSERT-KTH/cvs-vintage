    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>  
        Tomcat is a servlet container with a JSP environment.
        A servlet container is a runtime shell that manages and invokes 
        servlets on behalf of users.</p>
    
    <p>You can roughly partition servlet containers into:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong><u>Stand-alone servlet containers</u></strong><br>
        These are an integral part of the web server. This
        is the case when using a Java-based web server, for example the
        servlet container that is part of the JavaWebServer. Stand-alone
        is the default mode used by Tomcat.<br>
        Most web servers, however, are not Java-based, which leads us to
        the next two container types. </li>
        
      <li><strong><u>In-process servlet containers</u></strong><br> 
        The servlet container is a combination of a web server plugin and a 
        Java container implementation. The web server plugin opens a JVM 
        inside the web server's address space and lets the Java container 
        run in it. If a certain request should execute a Servlet, the plugin 
        takes control over the request and passes it (using JNI) to the Java 
        container. An in-process container is suitable for multi-threaded 
        single-process servers and provides good performance but is limited 
        in scalability. </li>
            
      <li><strong><u>Out-of-process servlet containers</u></strong><br>
        The servlet container is a combination of a
        web server plugin and a Java container implementation that runs
        in a JVM outside the web server. The web server plugin and the
        Java container JVM communicate using some IPC mechanism (usually
        TCP/IP sockets).
        If a certain request should execute a Servlet the plugin takes
        control over the request and passes it (using the IPCs) to the
        Java container.
        The response time of an out-of-process engine is not as good as
        in the in-process one but the out-of-process engine performs
        better in many measurable ways (scalability, stability, etc.).
      </li>   
    </ol>

    <p>Tomcat can be used as either a stand-alone container
      (mainly for development and debugging) or as an add-on to an
      existing web server (currently Apache, IIS and Netscape servers are 
      supported). This means that whenever you are deploying Tomcat you will 
      have to decide how to use it and, if you select options 2 or 3, you
      will also need to install a web server adapter.</p>

    <h2>What is the Difference Between Tomcat and Jserv? Isn't Tomcat==Jserv?</h2>
        <p>   
            This is a common misunderstanding. Jserv is a Servlet API
            2.0-compliant container that was created to be used with Apache. 
            Tomcat is a complete re-write and is a Servlet API 2.2 and JSP 
            1.1-compliant container.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Tomcat uses some of the code written for Jserv, especially 
            Jserv's Apache server adapter, but this is where the 
            similarities end.
        </p>

    <h2>How Do I Install the Binary Version of Tomcat?</h2>
    
    <p>Very simple. You should:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Download the zip/tar.gz/whatever file from
    <a HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">
      http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html</a>.
    
      <li>Unzip the file into some directory (say foo). This
    should create a new subdirectory named "tomcat".
    
    <li>Change directory to "tomcat" and set a new environment
        variable (TOMCAT_HOME) to point to the root directory of your 
        Tomcat hierarchy.
        <ol>
            <li>On Win32 you should type: <br>
                "set TOMCAT_HOME=foo\tomcat" </li>
        
            <li>On UNIX you should type: <br>
                for bash/sh "TOMCAT_HOME=foo/tomcat ; export TOMCAT_HOME"<br>
                for tcsh "setenv TOMCAT_HOME foo/tomcat"</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to the root
        directory of your JDK hierarchy, then add the Java interpreter
        to your PATH environment variable.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> That's it! You can now execute Tomcat and it will run as a
      stand-alone (type 1) servlet container.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting and Stopping Tomcat</h2>
    <p>You start and stop Tomcat using the scripts in
      the bin directory.</p>
    <P>To start Tomcat execute:</P>
    <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px">
      <p>On UNIX: bin/startup.sh</p>
      <p>On Win32: bin\startup</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To stop Tomcat execute: </p>
    <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px">
      <p>On UNIX: bin/shutdown.sh </p>
      <p>On Win32: bin\shutdown</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>The Tomcat directory structure</h2>
    <p>Assuming you unzipped/untared the Tomcat binary distribution
       you should have the following directory structure:</p>
    <table border width="75%" valign="MIDDLE">
      <tr>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" WIDTH="25%"> Directory name</th>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" WIDTH="75%"> Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> bin </td>
        <td> Contains startup/shutdown... scripts</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> conf </td>
        <td> Contains various configuration files including
          <em>server.xml</em> (Tomcat's main configuration file) and
          <em>web.xml</em>
          that sets
          the default values for the various web applications deployed in 
          Tomcat.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> doc </td>
        <td>Contains miscellaneous documents regarding Tomcat.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> lib </td>
        <td> Contains various jar files that are used by Tomcat. On UNIX 
             any file in this directory is appended to Tomcat's classpath.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> logs </td>
        <td> This is where Tomcat places it's log files.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
    <td> src </td>
    <td> The servlet APIs source files.&nbsp;Don't get excited,
      though; these are only the empty interfaces and abstract
      classes that should be implemented by any servlet
      container.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> webapps </td>
        <td> Contains sample web applications. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Additionally you can, or Tomcat will, create the following
        directories:</p>
    <table border width="75%" VALIGN="MIDDLE">
      <tr>
        <td> work </td>
        <td> Automatically generated by Tomcat, this is where Tomcat
             places intermediate files (such as compiled JSP files) during 
             it's work. If you delete this directory while Tomcat is running 
             you will not be able to execute JSP pages.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> classes </td>
        <td> You can create this directory to add additional classes to
             the classpath. Any class that you add to this directory will 
             find it's place in Tomcat's classpath.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>The Tomcat Scripts</h2>
    <p>Tomcat is a Java program, and therefore it is possible to execute
       it from the command line, after setting several environment 
       variables. However, setting each environment variable and following 
       the command line parameters used by Tomcat is error prone and 
       tedious. Instead, the Tomcat development team provides a few scripts 
       to ease starting and stopping Tomcat.</p>

    <p><b>Note: The scripts are only a convenient way to start/stop...
        You can modify them to customize the CLASSPATH, environment
        variables such as PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc., so long as a
        correct command line is generated for Tomcat.</b>
    </p>

    <p>What are these scripts? The following table presents the scripts that are
      most important for the common user:</p>
    <table border width="75%" valign="MIDDLE">
      <tr>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="25%"> Script name </th>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="75%"> Description </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> tomcat </td>
        <td> The main script. Sets the proper environment, including
          CLASSPATH, TOMCAT_HOME and JAVA_HOME, and starts Tomcat with
          the proper command line parameters.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> startup </td>
        <td> Starts tomcat in the background. Shortcut for "tomcat start" </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> shutdown </td>
        <td> Stops tomcat (shutting it down). Shortcut for "tomcat stop" </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The script which has the most significance for users is tomcat
       (tomcat.sh/tomcat.bat). The other Tomcat related scripts serve as a
       simplified single-task oriented entry point to the tomcat script (set
       different command line parameters etc.).</p>

    <p>
      A closer look at tomcat.sh/tomcat.bat yields that it performs the
      following actions:</p>

    <table border =1 width="75%" valign="MIDDLE">
      <tr>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="25%"> Operating System </th>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="75%"> Actions </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
    <td> Unix </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Guessing what is TOMCAT_HOME if it is not
          specified.
          
        <li>Guessing what is JAVA_HOME if it is not
          specified.
          
        <li>Setting up a CLASSPATH that contains -
          
          <ol>
            <li>The ${TOMCAT_HOME}/classes directory (if available).</li>
              
            <li>All the contents of ${TOMCAT_HOME}/lib. </li>
          
            <li>${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar (this jar file contains the tool
                javac, we need javac for jsp files).</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Executes java with command line parameters that set up a java
            system environment, called tomcat.home, with
            org.apache.tomcat.startup.Tomcat as the startup class. It also
            passes command line parameters to 
            org.apache.tomcat.startup.Tomcat, such as:
          
          <ol>
            <li>The operation to perform start/stop/run/etc.
              
            <li>A path to the server.xml used by this Tomcat process. </li>
          </ol>
          <p>For example if server.xml is located in /etc/server_1.xml and
             the user wants to start apache in the background they should 
             provide the following command line: 
             <div>bin/tomcat.sh start -f /etc/server_1.xml</div></p>
           </li>
       </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
    <td> Win32 </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting up a CLASSPATH that contains -
          
          <ol>
            <li> servlet.jar, webserver.jar, jasper.jar, xml.jar from the
                %TOMCAT_HOME%\lib directory, </li>
            <li> %TOMCAT_HOME%\classes (even if does not exist), </li>
            <li> %JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar (this jar file contains the tool
                 javac, we need javac for jsp files).</li>
         </ol>
        <li>Executes java, assuming that it is in the PATH, with command line
        parameters that set up a java system environment, called tomcat.home,
        with org.apache.tomcat.startup.Tomcat as the startup class. It also
        passes command line parameters to org.apache.tomcat.startup.Tomcat,
        such as:
          
        <ol>
            <li>The operation to perform start/stop/run/etc.

            <li>A path to the server.xml used by this Tomcat process. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example if server.xml is located in conf\server_1.xml and
           the user wants to start apache in the background they should 
           provide the following command line: 
           <div>bin\tomcat.bar start -f conf\server_1.xml</div></p>

        </li></ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, the Win32 version of tomcat.bat pales compared to the Unix
      one. Especially it does not guess the values of TOMCAT_HOME and
      JAVA_HOME and it also doesn't take all the jar files into the classpath.</p>

    <h2> Tomcat's Configuration Files </h2>
    <p> Tomcat's configuration is based on two files:
    <ol>
      <li> server.xml - Tomcat's global configuration file. </li>
      <li> web.xml - Configures the various contexts in Tomcat. </li>
    </ol>

    This section will deal with how to use these files. We are not going to cover the internals
    of web.xml, these internals are covered in depth in the Servlet APIs spec. Instead we will
    cover the content of server.xml and discuss the usage of web.xml in the context of Tomcat.
  </p>

    <h3> server.xml </h3>
    <p> server.xml is Tomcat's main configuration file. It serves two goals:
    <ol>
      <li> Providing initial configuration for the Tomcat components. </li>
      <li> Specifying structure for Tomcat, meaning, letting Tomcat
    boot and build itself by instantiating components as specified in
    server.xml.
    </ol>
    The important elements in server.xml are described in the following table:
    <table border width="75%" valign="MIDDLE">
      <tr>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="20%"> Element </th>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="80%"> Description </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Server </td>
        <td> The topmost element in the file server.xml. Server 
           defines a single Tomcat server. Generally you should not bother 
           with it too much. A Server element can contain elements of type 
           Logger and ContextManager. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Logger </td>
        <td> This element defines a logger object. Each logger has a name to identify
      it, as well as a path to the log file to contain the logger output and a
      verbosityLevel (that specifies the log level).
      Currently there are loggers for the servlets (where the ServletContext.log() goes),
      JSP files and the  tomcat runtime. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> ContextManager </td>
            <td> A ContextManager specifies the configuration and structure for a set of
          ContextInterceptors, RequestInterceptors, Contexts and their Connectors.
          The ContextManager has a few attributes that provides it with:
          <ol>
            <li> Debug level used for logging debug messages. </li>
            <li> The base location for webapps/, conf/, logs/ and all defined contexts.
                 It is used to start Tomcat from a directory other than 
				 TOMCAT_HOME.
            </li>
            <li> The name of the working directory. </li>
          </ol>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> ContextInterceptor & RequestInterceptor </td>
        <td> These interceptors listen for certain events that happen in
         the ContextManager. For example, the ContextInterceptor listens for
         startup and shutdown events of Tomcat, and the RequestInterceptor
         watches the various phases that user requests need to pass during
         it's service.
         Tomcat's administrator doesn't need to know much about the 
		 interceptors; a developer on the other hand should know that this 
		 is how "global" type of operations can be implemented in Tomcat 
		 (for example, security and per request logging). </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Connector </td>
        <td>The Connector represents a connection to the user, either
            through a web server or directly to the user's browser (in a
            stand-alone configuration).
            The connector object is the one responsible for the management of
            the Tomcat worker threads and for read/write requests/responses
            from the sockets connecting to the various clients.

          The configuration of the connectors includes information such as:
          <ol>
            <li> The <tt>handler</tt> class. </li>
            <li> The TCP/IP <tt>port</tt> where the handler listens.</li>
            <li> The TCP/IP <tt>backlog</tt> for the handler server socket. </li>
          </ol>
          We will describe how to use this Connector configuration later in the document.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Context </td>
        <td> Each Context represents a path in the Tomcat hierarchy where you
         place a web application. A Tomcat Context has the following
         configuration:
      <ol>
        <li>  The path where the context is located. This can be a full path
          or relative to the ContextManager's home. </li>
        <li> Debug level used for logging debug messages. </li>
        <li> A reloadable flag. When developing a servlet it is very 
		     convenient to have Tomcat reload it upon change, this lets you 
			 fix bugs and have Tomcat test the new code without the need to 
			 shutdown and restart. To turn on servlet reloading set the 
			 reloadable flag to true. Detecting changes however is time 
			 consuming; moreover, since the new servlets are getting loaded 
			 in a new class-loader object there are cases where this 
			 class-reloading trigger casts errors. To avoid these problems 
			 you can set the reloadable flag to false; this will disable the 
			 autoreload feature.</li>

    <h3> Starting Tomcat From Another Directory </h3>
    
    <p>By default tomcat will use TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml for configuration. The default 
       configuration will use TOMCAT_HOME as it's base for the contexts. </p>
    <p>You can change this by using the "-f /path/to/server.xml" option, with a
       different server configuration file and setting the home property of
       the context manger. You need to set up the required files inside the
       home: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A webapps/ directory (if you created one) - all war files will
              be expanded and all subdirectories added as contexts.</li>
          <li>conf/ directory - you can store a special web.xml and other
              configuration files.</li>
          <li>logs/ - all logs will go to this directory instead of the main
              TOMCAT_HOME/logs/.</li>
          <li>work/ - work directories for the contexts.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <p>If the ContextManager.home property in server.xml is relative, it
       will be relative to the current working directory.</p>

    <h3> web.xml </h3>
    <p>
      A detailed description of web.xml and the web application structure
      (including directory structure and configuration) is available in
      chapters 9, 10 and 14 of the
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Servlet API Spec</a>
      and we are not going to write about it. </p>
    <p>
      There is however a small Tomcat related "feature" that is related
      to web.xml.  Tomcat lets the user define default web.xml values for all
      context by putting a default web.xml file in the conf directory. When
      constructing a new Context, Tomcat uses the default web.xml file as the
      base configuration and the application specific web.xml (the one located
      in the application's WEB-INF/web.xml), only overwrite these defaults.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting Tomcat to Cooperate with the Apache Web Server </h2>

    <p> Up until now we have not discussed Tomcat as a server add on,
        instead we have considered it as a stand-alone container and discussed
        how it can be used. There are however a few problems with this
        picture:<p>
    <ol>
      <li> Tomcat is not as fast as Apache when it comes to static pages. </li>
      <li> Tomcat is not as configurable as Apache. </li>
      <li> Tomcat is not as robust as Apache. </li>
      <li> There are many sites with long time investment in certain web servers,
    for example, sites that are using CGI scripts/Server API modules/perl/php...
    We cannot assume that all of them will want to ditch this legacy. </li>
    </ol>

    <p> For all these reasons it is recommended that real world sites
        use a web server, such as Apache, for serving the static content of 
        the site, and use Tomcat as a Servlet/JSP add-on.</p>

    <p> We are not going to cover the different configuration in
        depth, instead we will:
    <ol>
      <li> Cover the fundamental behavior of the web server. </li>
      <li> Explain what configuration is needed. </li>
      <li> Demonstrate this on Apache. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Web Server Operation </h3>
    <p> In a nutshell a web server is waiting for client HTTP requests.
        When these requests arrive the server does whatever is needed to 
        serve the requests by providing the necessary content. Adding a 
        servlet container may somewhat change this behavior. Now the web 
        server needs also to perform the following:
    <ul>
      <li> Load the servlet container adapter library and initialize it (prior
           to serving requests). </li>
      <li> When a request arrives, it needs to check and see if a certain 
           request belongs to a servlet, if so it needs to let the adapter
           take the request and handle it.</li>
    </ul>

    The adapter on the other hand needs to know what requests it is
    going to serve, usually based on some pattern in the request URL, and to
    where to direct these requests.
  </p>

    <p>
      Things are even more complex when the user wants to set a configuration
      that uses virtual hosts, or when they want multiple developers to work
      on the same web server but on different servlet container JVMs. We 
      will cover these two cases in the advanced sections.
    </p>

    <h3> What is the Needed Configuration </h3>
    <p> The most obvious configuration that one can think of is the identity of the servlet URLs
      that are under the responsibility of the servlet container. This is clear; someone must
      know what requests to transmit to the servlet container...
      Yet there are additional configuration items that we should provide to
      the web-server/servlet-container combination:
    <ul>
      <li>We also need to provide configuration regarding the available Tomcat processes
    and on which TCP/IP host/port they are listening. </li>
      <li> We need to tell the web server the location of the adapter library (so it
    will be able to load it on startup). </li>
      <li> We need to set adapter internal information such as where and how much to log, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    All this information must appear either in the web server configuration, or in a private
    configuration files used by the adapter. The next section will demonstrate how configuration
    can be implemented on Apache.
  </p>


    <h3> Making it on Apache </h3>
    <p> This section shows you how to configure Apache to work with Tomcat;
        it tries to provide explanations as well as insight for the
 	    configuration directives that you should use. You can find
	    additional information in the
	    <a href="in http://java.apache.org/jserv/install/index.html">
        jserv install page </a>.
    </p>

    <p> When Tomcat starts up it will automatically generate a configuration
      file for Apache in <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf</tt>. Most
      of the time you don't need to do anything but include this file
      (appending "Include TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf") in your
      httpd.conf.  If you have special needs, for example an AJP port other
      the 8007, you can use this file as a base for  your customized
      configuration and save the results in another file.  If you manage
      the Apache configuration yourself you'll need to update it whenever
      you add a new context.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tomcat 3.1:</b> you must restart tomcat and apache after adding
      a new context; Apache doesn't support configuration changes without a
      restart. Also the file <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf</tt> is 
	  generated when tomcat starts, so you'll need to start Tomcat before 
	  Apache. Tomcat will overwrite <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf</tt> 
	  each startup so customized configuration should be kept elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p> The Apache-Tomcat configuration uses Apache core configuration directives
      as well as Jserv unique directives so it may confuse you at first, there are
      however two things simplifying it:
    <ul>
      <li> In general you can distinguish between the two directive
           "families" by noting that all the Jserv unique directives start
           with an "Ajp" prefix. </li>
      <li> The entire Tomcat related configuration is concentrated in a
           single configuration file named tomcat.conf, or the automatically
           generated tomcat-apache.conf, so you can look at a single file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Lets look now at a sample tomcat.conf file.

        </td> 
      </tr> 
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>As you can see the configuration process was split into 4 steps
       that will now be explained:
      <ol>
      <li> In this step we instruct Apache to load the jserv
           shared-object (or the NT world dll). This is a well known Apache
           directive. If the loading went well and the module came from a 
           file named mod_jserv.c (1a) we can start with the rest of the 
           Jserv-Tomcat configuration. </li>
      <li> This step sets various Jserv internal parameters, these
           parameters:
        <ul>
          <li> Instruct jserv not to start the Tomcat process. Automatically
               starting Tomcat is not implemented yet.</li>
          <li> Disable the secret key challenge/response between Apache and Tomcat.
            Again, the secret key work is not implemented yet.</li>
          <li> Instruct jserv to copy the base server mount points (see next
               section) in case of virtual hosting. </li>
          <li> Instruct jserv to use the notice log level. Other log levels
               include emerg, alert, crit, error, warn, info and debug.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> This step sets the default communication parameters.
        Basically it says that the default protocol used for the communication
        is ajpv12 (do not mess with this one) and that the Tomcat process runs on
        the same machine and listens on port 8007. If you run Tomcat on a
        machine other than the one used
        for Apache you should either update your ApJServDefaultHost or use a full
        URL when mounting contexts (see next). Also, if you configured the Tomcat
        connectors to use a port other then 8007, you should update your
        ApJServDefaultPort or use a full URL when mounting contexts.
      </li>
      <li> This step mounts a context to Tomcat. Basically it says that
           all the web server paths that start with /examples go to Tomcat. This
           ApJServMount example is a rather simple one, in fact ApJServMount can
           also provide information regarding the communication protocol to be used
           and the location where the Tomcat process listens, for example:
           <div><tt>ApJServMount /examples ajpv12://hostname:port/root</tt></div>
           mounts the context /examples to a Tomcat process that runs on host
           "hostname" and listens on port number "port".
      </li>
    </ol>
    Now that you understand the different configuration instructions in the sample
    file, how can you add it to the Apache configuration? One "simple" method is to
    write it's content in the httpd.conf (the Apache configuration file), this however
    can be very messy. Instead you should use the Apache include directive. At the end
    of the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) add the following directive:
    <div> <tt>include &lt;full path to the Tomcat configuration file&gt; </tt></div>
    for example:
    <div> <tt>include /tome/tomcat/conf/tomcat.conf </tt></div> This
    will add your Tomcat configuration to Apache, after that you should copy
    the jserv module to the Apache libexec (or modules in the Win32 case)
    directory and restart (stop+start) Apache. It should now be able to
    connect to Tomcat.
    </p>

    <h3> Obtaining the Jserv Module (mod_jserv) </h3>
    <p> As previously stated, we need a web server adapter to sit in Apache and redirect
      requests to Tomcat. For Apache, this adapter is a slightly modified version of
      mod_jserv.
    </p>
    <p> You may try to look <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">
      here </a> and see if there is an already pre-built version of mod_jserv that
      suites your OS (Usually there is one for NT), however, being a native library you
      should not expect that yet (too many OS's, not enough developers, life
      too short...).
      Moreover, small variations in the way you built Apache/Your specific UNIX variant may
      result in dynamic linking errors. You should really try to build mod_jserv for your
      system (don't panic, it is not that hard!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Building mod_jserv on <b>UNIX</b> involves the following:
    <ol>
      <li> Download the source distribution of Tomcat from
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/sourceindex.html"> here</a>. </li>
      <li> Uncompress it into some directory. </li>
      <li> Building the module:
    <ul>
      <li> Change directory into jakarta-tomcat/src/native/apache/jserv/</li>
      <li> Execute the build command <div><tt> apxs -c *.c -o mod_jserv.so </tt></div> 
        apxs is part of the Apache distribution and should be located in your
        APACHE_HOME/bin.</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>  
    Building mod_jserv for <b>Win32</b> is less likely (you already have a downloadable dll
    for Win32). Yet if you <em>want</em> to build it you should install Visual C++ and 
    perform the following:
    <ol>
      <li> Download the source distribution of Tomcat from
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/sourceindex.html"> here</a>. </li>
      <li> Unzip it into some directory. </li>
      <li> Building the module:
    <ul>
      <li> Change directory into jakarta-tomcat\src\native\apache\jserv</li>
      <li> Add  Visual C++ into your environment by executing the script
        VCVARS32.BAT. </li>
      <li> Execute the build command <div><tt> nmake -f Makefile.win32 </tt></div>
        nmake is the Visual C++ make program.</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    That's it; you have built mod_jserv...
    </p>
    <h3> Making Apache Serve your Context's Static Files </h3>
    <p> The previous Apache-Tomcat configuration file was somewhat
	    inefficient, it instructed Apache to send any request for a resource
        that starts with the <tt>/examples</tt> prefix to be served by
        Tomcat. Do we really want that? There are many static files that may
        be a part of our servlet context (for example images and static
        HTML), why should Tomcat serve these files?
    </p>
    <p>You may actually have reasons for doing that, for example:
        <ol>
            <li>You may want to configure Tomcat based security for these
                resources. </li>
            <li>You may want to follow users requests for static resources
                using interceptors. </li>
        </ol>
       In general however, this is not that case; and making Tomcat save
       static files is just a CPU waste. We should instead have Apache serve
       these static files and not Tomcat. Lets look now at a sample
       tomcat.conf file that does exactly that:
    </p>
    <p> Having Apache serve the static files requires the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Instructing Apache to send all servlet requests to Tomcat. </li>
            <li>Instructing Apache to send all JSP requests to Tomcat. </li>
        </ol>
        and leaving Apache to handle the rest. Lets look now at a sample 
        tomcat.conf file that does exactly that:
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see, the beginning of this configuration file is the same
      as seen in the previous example. The last step (mounting a context),
      however,  was replaced in a long series of Apache and Ajp
      configuration directives that will now be explained:
      <ol>
        <li> This step informs Apache of the context location and aliases it
             to an Apache virtual directory. This way Apache can serve files
             from this directory.</li>
        <li> This optional step instructs Apache more about how to serve the
             context; for example you can decide if Apache will allow
             directory indexing (listing) or set a special index file.</li>
        <li> This step instructs Apache to protect the WEB-INF directory
             from client access. For security reasons it is important to
             prevent visitors from viewing the content of the WEB-INF
             directory, for example web.xml can provide valuable information
             for intruders. This step blocks the WEB-INF content from
             visitors. </li>
        <li> This step instructs Apache to serve all the jsp locations
             within the context using the jserv servlet handler. The servlet
             handler redirects these requests based on the default host and
             port.</li>
        <li> This step mounts specific servlet URLs to Tomcat. You should
             note that you should have as many such mount directives as the
             number of specific servlet URLs. </li>
        <li> This last step is an example for the addition of servlet only 
             context to Tomcat. </li>                                       
      </ol>
      
      It is easy to see that this configuration is much more complex and
      error prone then the first example, this however is the price that you 
      should (for now) pay for improved performance.
    </p>

    <h3> Configuring for Multiple Tomcat JVMs </h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes it is useful to have different contexts handled by 
        different JVMs, for example: 
        <ul>
            <li> When each context serves a different, specific task and runs
                 on a different machine. </li>
            <li> When we want to have multiple developers work on a private
                 Tomcat process but use the same web server. </li>
        </ul>
        Implementing such schemes where different contexts are served by
        different JVMs is very easy and the following configuration file
        demonstrates this:
    </p>

    As you can see in the previous example, using several JVMs (even even 
	those that run on different machines) can be accomplished easily by 
	using a full Ajp URL mount. In this full URL we actually specify the 
	host where the Tomcat process is located and it's port.
    </p>
    <p>
    Had the two Tomcat processes run on the same machine, we would have to
    configure each of them with different connector ports. For example,
    assuming that the two JVMs runs on localhost, the Apache-Tomcat
    configuration should have something that looks like:

    Looking at the above file you can see that we have two explicit Ajp
    mount points each pointing to a different port on the same machine. It
    is clear that this configuration requires support from the configuration
    found in the server.xml files. We will need in these files different
    &lt;Connector&gt; configurations, for the different Tomcat processes. We
    will actually need two different server.xml files (lets call them
    server_joe.xml and server_bill.xml) with different &lt;Connector&gt;
    entries as shown in the next two samples:

        The port configuration is not the only place where the joe and bill
        configuration differs. We have @@@ marks in the xml files marking
        the four places where changes had to be made. As you can see, this
        difference is necessary to avoid the two Tomcat processes from
		overwriting each other's logs and workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we should start the two tomcat processes using the -f command
        line option:
        <div> bin\starup -f conf\server_joe.xml</div>
        <div> bin\starup -f conf\server_bill.xml</div>
        and then access them from Apache based on the different URL path
        prefixes.

    <h3> Configuring Virtual Hosting </h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to support virtual hosts under Tomcat Ver3.1, in fact
        the virtual host configuration is very similar to configuring for
        multiple JVM (as explained in the previous section) and the reason
        is simple; in Tomcat 3.1 each virtual host is implemented by a 
		different Tomcat process.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the current (Ver3.1) Tomcat, virtual hosting awareness is
        provided by the web server (Apache/Netscape). The web server
        virtual hosting support is used by the Tomcat adapter to
        redirect requests belonging to a certain virtual host to the JVM(s)
        containing the contexts of this virtual host. This means that if (for
        example) we have two virtual hosts (vhost1 and vhost2), we will have
        two JVMs: one running the contexts of vhost1 and the other running
        the contexts of vhost2. These JVMs are not aware of each others 
		existence, in fact, they are not aware of the concept of virtual 
		hosting. All the virtual hosting logic is inside the web-server 
		adapter. To make things clearer, lets look at the following sample 
		Apache-Tomcat configuration file:
    </p>

    <p>
        As can be seen, steps 1,2 and 3 define two Apache virtual hosts and 
        for each of them, mount the /examples context to a certain ajpv12 URL. 
        Each such ajpv12 URL points to a JVM that contains the virtual host. 
        The configuration of the two JVMs is very similar to the one
        demonstrated in the previous section, we will need again to use two 
        different server.xml files (one for each virtual host process) and
        we will need to start the Tomcat processes with the -f command line 
        option. After doing that we will be able to approach Apache, each
        time with a different host name, and the adapter will redirect us to 
        the appropriate JVM.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>The need for improved virtual host support</u></strong><br>
        Having each virtual host implemented by a different JVM is a huge 
        scalability problem. The next versions of Tomcat will make it 
        possible to support several virtual hosts within the same Tomcat 
        JVM.
    </p>
    <h2> Real World Configuration Tips </h2>
    <p>
        By default the Tomcat distribution comes with a naive configuration
        whose main goal is to promote first time user experience and an "out 
		of the box" operation... This configuration however is not the best 
		way to deploy Tomcat on real sites. For example, real sites may 
		require some performance tuning and site-specific settings 
		(additional path elements for example). This section will try to get 
		you started by directing you to the first steps that should be taken 
		before publishing a Tomcat based site.
    </p>

    <h3> Modify and Customize the Batch Files </h3>
    <p>
        As stated in the previous sections, the startup scripts are here for 
		your convenient.  Yet, sometimes the scripts that are needed for
        deployment should be modified:
        <ul>
            <li> To set resource limits such as maximum number of
                 descriptors. </li>
            <li> To add new CLASSPATH entries (for example, JDBC drivers). </li>
            <li> To add new PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH entries (for example, JDBC
                 drivers DLLs). </li>
            <li> To modify the JVM command line settings. </li>
            <li> Make sure that you are using a specific JVM (out of the two
                 or three JVMs installed on your machine). </li>
            <li> To switch user from root to some other user using the "su"
                 UNIX command. </li>
            <li> Your pet reason. </li>
        </ul>

        Some of these changes can be done without explicit changes to
        the basic scripts; for example, the tomcat script can use an 
		environment variable named <tt>TOMCAT_OPTS</tt> to set extra command
        line parameters to the JVM (such as memory setting etc.).
        On <em>UNIX</em> you can also create a file named <tt>".tomcatrc"</tt> in
        your home directory and Tomcat will take environment information such
        as PATH, JAVA_HOME, TOMCAT_HOME and CLASSPATH from this file. On NT
        however (and also on UNIX when the modifications are for something
        such as the JVM command line) you are forced to rewrite some of the
        startup script... <div><b> Do not hesitate, just do it.</b> </div>
    </p>

    <h3> Modify the Default JVM Settings </h3>
    <p>
        The default JVM settings in the tomcat script are very nave;
        everything is left for defaults. There are a few things that you
        should consider to improve your Tomcat performance:
        <ol>
            <li> Modify your JVM memory configuration. Normally the JVM
           allocates an initial size for the Java heap and that's it, if
           you need more then this amount of memory you will not get it.<br>
           Nevertheless, in loaded sites, giving more memory to the JVM
           improves Tomcat's performance. You should use command line
           parameters such as -Xms/-Xmx/-ms/-mx to set the minimum/maximum
           size of the Java heap (and check to see if the performance was
           improved). </li>

            <li> Modify your JVM threading configuration. The SUN JDK1.2.2 for
           Linux comes with support for both, green and native threads. In
           general native threads are known to provide improved performance
           for I/O bound applications, green threads on the other hand put
           less stress on the machine. You should experiment with these two
           threading models and see which model is better for your site (in
           general, native threads are better).</li>

            <li> Select the best JVM for the task. There are several JVM vendors,
           for example on Linux there are today (21/03/2000) two product level
           JVMs: the SUN JDK1.2.2 and the IBM JDK1.1.8. If your application
           does not require a specific JDK functionality, you should
           benchmark the two JVMs and select the better one. In my (Gal
           Shachor) internal tests I found the IBM JVM significantly faster
           than the one created by SUN, you should check that for yourself
           and make a calculated decision.
           </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3> Modify your Connectors </h3>
    <p>
        The Connectors, as configured in Tomcat's default server.xml
        contains two Connectors configured as in the next server.xml
        fragment:

        <p>
        <table border="1"
            cellspacing="0"
            cellpadding="0"
            valign="middle">

            <em> The two default Connectors in server.xml </em>
          </caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
                <pre>
        &lt;!-- (1) HTTP Connector for stand-alone operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className="org.apache.tomcat.service.SimpleTcpConnector"&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="handler"
                value="org.apache.tomcat.service.http.HttpConnectionHandler"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="port"
                value="8080"/&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;

        &lt;!-- (2) AJPV12 Connector for out-of-processs operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className="org.apache.tomcat.service.SimpleTcpConnector"&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="handler"
                value="org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp12ConnectionHandler"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="port"
                value="8007"/&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;
                </pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Is a Connector that listens on port 8080 for incoming HTTP
                 requests. This connector is needed for stand-alone
                 operation.
            <li> Is a Connector that listens on port 8007 for incoming AJPV12
                 requests. This connector is needed for web-server
                 integration (out-of-process servlet integration).
        </ol>

        It is clear that a sane Tomcat deployment will use either an
        out-of-process servlet integration or a stand-alone operation,
        removing the unnecessary Connector is important.
    </p>
    <h3> Use a Thread Pool in your Connectors </h3>
    <p>
        Tomcat is a multi-threaded servlet container this means that each
        request needs to be executed by some thread. By default when a
        request arrives Tomcat creates a new thread, starts it and has it
        serve the request. This behavior is problematic for loaded sites
        because:
        <ul>
            <li>Starting and stopping a thread  for every request puts a
                needless burden on the operating system and the JVM. </li>
            <li>It is hard to limit the resource consumption. If 300
                requests arrive concurrently Tomcat will open 300
                threads to serve them and allocate all the resources needed
                to serve all the 300 requests at the same time.  This causes
                Tomcat to allocate much more resources (CPU, Memory,
                Descriptors...) than it should and it can lead to low
                performance and even crashes if resources are exhausted. </li>
        </ul>
        The solution for these problems is to use a <b>thread pool</b>.
        Servlet containers that are using a thread pool relieve themselves
        from directly managing their threads. Instead of allocating new
        threads; whenever they need a thread they ask for it from the pool,
        and when they are done, the thread is returned to the pool. The
        thread pool can now be used to implement sophisticated thread
        management techniques, such as:
        <ol>
            <li> Keeping threads "open" and reusing them over and over
                 again. This saves the trouble associated with creating and 
				 destructing threads continuously.
                 <ul> <li>
                 Usually the administrator can instruct the pool not to keep
                 too many idle threads, freeing them if needed.
                 </li> </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Setting an upper bound on the number of threads used
                 concurrently. This prevents the resources allocation
                 problem associated with unlimited thread allocation.
                 <ul> <li>
                 If the container maxed out to the threads upper limit, and a new
                 request arrives, the new request will have to wait for
                 some other (previous) request to finish and free the thread
                 used to service it.
                 </li> </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        You can refine the techniques described above in various ways, but
        these are only refinements. The main contribution of thread pools is
        thread-reuse and having a concurrency upper bound that limits
        resource usage.

    <p>
        Using a thread pool in Tomcat is a simple move; all you need to do
        is to use a <tt>PoolTcpConnector</tt> in your &lt;Connector&gt;
        configuration. For example the following server.xml fragment defines
        ajpv12, pooled Connector:

        <p>
        <table border="1"
            cellspacing="0"
            cellpadding="0"
            valign="middle">
          <caption valign="bottom" width="100%">
            <em> Pooled ajpv12 Connector </em>
          </caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
                <pre>
        &lt;!-- A pooled AJPV12 Connector for out-of-processs operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className="org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector"&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="handler"
                value="org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp12ConnectionHandler"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="port"
                value="8007"/&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;
                </pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>

        This fragment is very simple and the (default) pool behaviour
        instructed by it is:
        <ul>
            <li> Upper bound for concurrency of 50 threads. </li>
            <li> When the pool has more then 25 threads standing idle it
                 will start to kill them. </li>
            <li> The pool will start 10 threads on creation, and it will try
                 to keep 10 vacant threads (as long as the upper bound is
                 kept). </li>
        </ul>
        The default configuration is suitable for medium load sites with an
        average of 10-40 concurrent requests. If your site differs you
        should modify this configuration (for example reduce the upper
        limit). Configuring the pool can be done through the &lt;Connector&gt;
        element in server.xml as demonstrated in the next fragment:
        <p>
        <table border="1"
            cellspacing="0"
            cellpadding="0"
            valign="middle">
          <caption valign="bottom" width="100%">
            <em> Configuring the Thread Pool </em>
          </caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
                <pre>
        &lt;!-- A pooled AJPV12 Connector for out-of-processs operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className="org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector"&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="handler"
                value="org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp12ConnectionHandler"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="port"
                value="8007"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="max_threads"
                value="30"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="max_spare_threads"
                value="20"/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name="min_spare_threads"
                value="5" /&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;
                </pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        As can be seen the pool has 3 configuration parametes:
        <ul>
            <li> max_threads - defines the upper bound to the for the 
			     concurrency, the pool will not create more then this number 
				 of threads. </li>
            <li> max_spare_threads - defines the maximum number of threads
                 that the pool will keep idle. If the number of idle threads
                 passes the value of max_spare_threads the pool will kill
                 these threads. </li>
            <li> min_spare_threads - the pool will try to make sure that at
                 any time there is at least this number of idle threads
                 waiting for new requests to arrive. min_spare_threads must
                 be bigger then 0.</li>
        </ul>

        You should use the above parameters to adjust the pool behavior to
        your needs.

    <h3> Disable Servlet Auto-Reloading </h3>
    <p>
        Servlet auto-reloading is really useful for development time.
        However it is very expensive (in performance degradation terms) and
        may put your application in strange conflicts when classes that were
        loaded by a certain classloader cannot co-operate with classes
        loaded by the current classloader.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, unless you have a real need for class reloading during your
        deployment you should turn off the reloadable flag in your contexts.
    </p>

    <h3> Start Tomcat from /etc/inittab </h3>
    <p>
        Unfortunately the adapters developed for Apache (or for any of the
        other servers) cannot start Tomcat yet. On UNIX however, you can
        use the init table to start Tomcat automatically upon machine
        startup. FIXME:

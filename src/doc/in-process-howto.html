<h1>In-Process HowTo</h1>

<p>By Gal Shachor &lt;shachor@il.ibm.com&gt;</p>

<p>This document explains how to set up Netscape/IIS web servers so that
Tomcat will run inside the web server process. <b>It assumes that you have
already followed the instructions in the web server specific howto and
configured it to use Tomcat as an out of process servlet container.</b>
</p>

<p>
Normally Tomcat is running in one process and the web servers runs in another;
this however requires the web server to communicate using some IPC mechanism
such as TCP/IP. <br>

When Tomcat is running inside the web server process, requests for servlet
execution are passed using JNI (and performance improves).
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Running the JVM inside the web server is not always a good
idea. Sure it gives the best performance, but is lacks the stability
associated with the out of process mode of operation. When deciding to run
in-process make sure that top speed is what you need.
</p>

<h2>Document Conventions and Assumptions</h2>

<p>&lt;tomcat_home&gt; is the root directory of tomcat. Your Tomcat
installation should have the following subdirectories:

<ol>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\conf - Where you can place various configuration files</li>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\webapps - Containing example applications </li>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\bin - Where you place web server plugins </li>
</ol>

<p>In all the examples in this document &lt;tomcat_home&gt; will be d:\tomcat.</p>

<p>A <tt>worker</tt> is defined to be a Tomcat process that accepts work from
the web server.</p>

<h2>Supported Configuration</h2>

<p>For in-process operation you will have to use the Netscape/IIS
redirectors, look at their supported configuration sections.

<p>The in-process adapter was tested using JDK1.1.7b/IBM's JDK 1.1.7/JDK1.2.2.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The in-process adapter is not part of the "official" build of Jakarta, You
can obtain the code and binaries needed for it by accessing
http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v3.1_beta_1/bin/win32/i386/.
The adapter related file is <tt>jni_connect.dll</tt>.</p>

<p>The Tomcat JNI adapter requires the following actions:

<ol>
  <li>Putting jni_connect.dll in the bin directory - jni_connect.dll is used
  to issue callbacks from Tomcat back to the web server, either obtain a
  pre-built DLL or build it yourself (see the build section).</li>
  <li>Update <tt>workers.properties</tt> and add the JNI worker - The JNI worker
  needs several configuration items, you will need to add those to the worker
  properties file.</li>
  <li>Updating server.xml - You need to instruct Tomcat to use the JNI
  connection handlers. You will also need to provide the home property for
  your ContextManager (later on the log files and work directories will
  be created under this home). </li>
  <li>Directing context(s) to the in-process Tomcat - You need to instruct
  the redirector to send work to the in-process Tomcat</li>
  <li>Restart your server (so changes will take effect)</li>
</ol>


<h3>Putting jni_connect.dll in the bin directory</h3>

<p> Put jni_connect.dll inside 
    <tt>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\bin\i386\</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Update worker.properties and add the JNI worker</h3>
<p> You should provide the JNI worker with several settings, some are
mandatory and some are an option...
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You <b>should</b> define a JNI worker.<br>
  Set the <tt>worker.list</tt> property to point on a worker named <tt>jni</tt>:
  <tt>worker.list=jni</tt><br>
  Announce that the worker named <tt>jni</tt> is of type <tt>jni</tt>:
  <tt>worker.jni.type=jni</tt>
  <li>You <b>should</b> set a classpath to be use by the in-process Tomcat.<br>
  To set the classpath use the <tt>worker.name.class_path</tt> property,
  for example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.class_path=d:\tomcat\classes</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.class_path=d:\tomcat\lib\xml.jar</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.class_path=d:\tomcat\lib\jasper.jar</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.class_path=d:\tomcat\lib\servlet.jar</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.class_path=d:\tomcat\lib\webserver.jar</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.class_path=d:\sdk\jdk1.2.2\lib\tools.jar</tt><br>
  <b>Note</b>: Do not forget to include the JDK's tools.jar in your classpath.
  </li>
  <li>You <b>should</b> provide a full path to the dll implementing the JVM.
  For JDK1.1.x it is javai.dll, for JDK1.2.x it is jvm.dll. For example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.jvm_lib=d:\sdk\jdk1.2.2\jre\bin\classic\jvm.dll</tt>
  </li>
  <li>You <b>should</b> provide command line options for Tomcat; you must provide
  a -config option to specify your JNI configured server.xml. For example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.cmd_line=-config</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.cmd_line=d:\tomcat\conf\jni_server.xml</tt>
  </li>
  <li>You <b>should</b> specify the tomcat home location as a Java system
  properties. For example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.sysprops=tomcat.home=d:\tomcat</tt>
  </li>
  <li>You can specify additional Java system properties. For example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.sysprops=java.compiler=NONE</tt>
  </li>
  <li>You can specify files to by used by the JVM for stdout and stderr.
  For example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.stdout=d:\jvm.stdout</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.stderr=d:\jvm.stderr</tt>
  </li>
  <li>You can specify additional PATH, to be use when loading dlls (useful
  when you are using native code). For example:<br>
  <tt>worker.jni.ld_path=d:\SQLLIB\bin</tt><br>
  <tt>worker.jni.ld_path=d:\my\native\code</tt>
  </li>
</ol>
You can find a sample worker file (<tt>jni_workers.properties</tt>)  under <tt>tomcat/conf</tt>.

<h3>Update server.xml</h3>
<p>
By default Tomcat reads the file &lt;tomcat_home&gt;\conf\server.xml. This
file defines among other things the contexts and connectors used by Tomcat.
In order to work in-process you will have to perform the following actions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You should update the connectors list.<br>
  Remove all the connectors from your server.xml and add the following
  lines (note that you will need to update the area marked
  with &lt;tomcat_home&gt;)
  <pre>
    &lt;!-- New JNI, you need to compile the new/experimental module --&gt;
    &lt;Connector className="org.apache.tomcat.service.JNIEndpointConnector"&gt;
        &lt;Parameter name="native_lib" value="&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\bin\i386\jni_connect.dll"/&gt;
    &lt;/Connector&gt;
  </pre>
  These lines add a JNI connector to Tomcat.
  <li>You should update the <tt>home</tt> attribute used by the
  ContextManager so that the ContextManager will know where to place the
  log, work and webapps directories. For example:
  <pre>
    &lt;ContextManager debug="0" workDir="work" home="&lt;tomcat_home&gt;" /&gt;
    .
    .
    .
    &lt;/ContextManager /&gt;
  </pre>
  Again, make sure that you update &lt;tomcat_home&gt; to your real Tomcat
  root.
  </li>
</ol>
You can find a sample server file (<tt>jni_server.xml</tt>) under <tt>jakarta-tomcat/conf</tt>.

<h3>Redirect contexts to the JNI workers</h3>
<p>You will need to select the contexts that you wish to serve using your
jni worker.</p>

<p>On Netscape you can do that by modifying the lines in the servlet
configuration object to reflect redirect work to the new JNI worker.
For example:
<pre>
    &lt;Object name=servlet&gt;
    ObjectType fn=force-type type=text/plain
    Service fn="jk_service" worker="jni"
    &lt;/Object&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>On IIS you will have to modify your worker mount file to mount contexts
to the JNI worker. For example:</p>

<tt>/examples/*=jni</tt>

<p>When you are done restart your server. That's all, you should now be able
to execute Tomcat in-process.</p>

<h2>Building the JNI connector dll</h2>

<p>The JNI connector was developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, so having this
environment is a prereq if you want to perform a custom build. You will also
need a JDK installation (the jre is not good enough) in order to use
the JDK's include files.</p>

<p>The steps that you need to take are:

<ol>
  <li>Change directory to the JNI connector source directory.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the environment variable <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> is set and
  points to your JDK installation</li>
  <li>Execute the following command:<br>
    <tt>MSDEV jni_connect.dsp /MAKE ALL</tt><br>
    If msdev is not in your path, enter the full path to msdev.exe</li>
</ol>

<p>This will build both release and debug versions of the JNI connector. </p>

<p>An alternative will be to open the jni_connect workspace file
(jni_connect.dsw) in msdev and build it using the build menu.</p>

<h2>How does it work? </h2>
Working in-process requires both the server redirector
(IIS-Tomcat/Netscape-Tomcat) and the in-process connector. The server
redirector can direct work to different workers based on their name; now
that we added the JNI worker the server redirector can forward it work...

The basic operation is this:
<ol>
  <li>During the initialization the server redirector starts the JNI worker.</li>
  <li>Upon startup the JNI worker creates a JVM inside the web server and
  starts Tomcat in it.</li>
  <li>For each in-coming request for a servlet, the server redirector will
  check which worker is responsible for the specific context. If this worker 
  is the JNI worker then the request is assigned to it.</li>
  <li>The JNI worker attaches to the JVM and submits the request into the
  Tomcat engine (using the JNIEndpointConnector). Tomcat will then execute
  the request.</li>
  <li>The server redirector collects the response from the JNI worker and
  returns it to the browser.</li>
</ol>

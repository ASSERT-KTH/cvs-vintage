<h1>2. INSTALLATION</h1>

<!-- 2.1 JDK -->
<a name="JDK"></a>
<h2>2.1 Java Development Kit</h2>

<p>Tomcat will operate under any Java Development Kit (JDK) environment that
provides a JDK 1.1 or JDK 1.2 (also known as Java2 Standard Edition, or J2SE)
compatible platform.  You will need a Java Development Kit, as opposed to a
Java Runtime Environment, so that your servlets, other classes, and JSP pages
can be compiled.

<p>Compatible JDKs for many platforms (or links to where they can be found)
are available at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/jdk/">http://java.sun.com/jdk/</a>.

<p>The shell command line examples in this manual assume that you have
set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to point at the base
directory where you have installed the JDK (such as
<code>/usr/local/jdk1.2.2</code>), have added the
<code>$JAVA_HOME/bin</code> directory to your <code>PATH</code>
environment variable (so that the compiler and other executable
components can be located), and have initialized the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable if necessary.

<!-- 2.2 Tomcat -->
<a name="Tomcat"></a>
<h2>2.2 Jakarta Tomcat</h2>

<p>Binary downloads of the Tomcat server are available from the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html</a>
page.  This manual assumes you are using the most recent milestone,
beta, or release of Tomcat 3.1 -- many of the deployment details
have changed since Tomcat 3.0 was released, although the general
concepts are very similar.

<p>The shell command line examples in this manual assume that you have
set the <code>TOMCAT_HOME</code> environment variable to point at the
base directory where you have installed Tomcat (such as
<code>/usr/local/tomcat</code>), and have added the
<code>$TOMCAT_HOME/bin</code> directory to your <code>PATH</code>
environment variable.  No adjustment to the <code>CLASSPATH</code>
environment variable is normally required, unless your application
requires additional Java classes or JAR files to be added to the
system classpath.

<!-- 2.3 Ant -->
<a name="Ant"></a>
<h2>2.3 Jakarta Ant</h2>

<p>Binary downloads of the Ant development tool are available from the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html</a>
page.  This manual assumes you are using the most recent milestone,
beta, or release of Tomcat 3.1 -- many of the deployment details
have changed since Tomcat 3.0 was released, although the general
concepts are very similar.

<p>The shell command line examples in this manual assume that you have
set the <code>ANT_HOME</code> environment variable to point at the
base directory where you have installed Ant (such as
<code>/usr/local/ant</code>), and have added the
<code>$ANT_HOME/bin</code> directory to your <code>PATH</code>
environment variable.  No adjustment to the <code>CLASSPATH</code>
environment variable is normally required.


<!-- 2.4 CVS -->
<a name="CVS"></a>
<h2>2.4 Concurrent Version System (CVS)</h2>

<p>Besides the required tools described above, you are strongly encouraged
to download and install a <i>source code control</i> system, such as CVS,
to maintain historical versions of the source files that make up your
web application.  Besides the server, you will also need appropriate client
tools to check out source code files, and check in modified versions.

<p>Detailed instructions for installing and using source code control
applications is beyond the scope of this manual.  However, CVS server and
client tools for many platforms (along with documentation) can be downloaded
from <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS">http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS</a>.

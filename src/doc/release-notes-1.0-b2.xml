  <section name="What's New?" href="New">

    <p><strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong> - The entire custom tag library
    that is documented in <code>struts.tld</code> has been deprecated.
    These tags correspond to the Struts 0.5 functionality that is also
    deprecated, and have been replaced (and considerably enhanced) in
    the various individual tag libraries.</p>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the
    <em>struts-html</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code> tag now accepts an optional
        <code>anchor</code> attribute, to allow the inclusion of a
        (possibly calculated) anchor ("#xxx") in the generated hyperlink.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:base&gt;</code> tag now accepts an optional
        <code>target</code> attribute.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the
    <em>struts-template</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.template</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Attribute getter methods have been added to all of the custom
        tag implementation classes to facilitate reuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the Struts Documentation
    application (and corresponding contents on the Struts web site):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Platform specific installation notes for a wide variety of application
        server and servlet container environments have been accumulated and
        published.</li>
    </ul>

  <section name="Changes and Bug Fixes" href="Changes">

    <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occured in the
    <em>struts-html</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:image&gt;</code> tag now correctly generates a
        closing double quote on the <code>name</code> attribute.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:form&gt;</code> tag now generates a hyperlink
        that includes any query parameters that were included in the original
        hyperlink value.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code> tag now correctly places any
        specified anchor ("#xxx") in the generated hyperlink.</li>
    <li>The JavaScript code generated to implement the <code>focus</code>
        attribute of the <code>&lt;html:form&gt;</code> tag now works even
        when you use nested or indexed property expressions.  Previously,
        this would generate an invalid JavaScript reference to the field.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Struts Documentation
    application (and corresponding contents on the Struts web site) have
    occurred:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The Java types of collections (and arrays) over which the
        <code>&lt;logic:iterate&gt;</code> tag can run are now documented.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;bean:define&gt;</code> documentation now mentions the
        JSP 1.1 Specification restriction on using more than one
        <code>id</code> attribute with the same value in the same page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Struts Example Applications
    have occurred:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The Java source code of these applications is now included in the
        corresponding WAR files, in subdirectory <code>WEB-INF/src</code>.</li>
    <li>Excessive filter() calls in <code>LinkSubscriptionTag</code>
        have been eliminated.</li>
    <li>Calls to the deprecated <code>BeanUtils.filter()</code> have been
        replaced by calls to <code>ResponseUtils.filter(</code>.</li>
    </ul>

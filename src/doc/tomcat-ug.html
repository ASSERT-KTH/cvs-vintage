<H1>Tomcat 3.3 User's Guide</H1>

<p>This document is an introduction to the Tomcat 3.3 servlet
	container. It should be enough for anyone to install,
	configure, and deploy Tomcat 3.3, or later. As well, it answers many
	questions common to new users. If you have any comments or suggestions
	about this document don't hesitate to send them to the
	Tomcat <a	href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">mailing
	lists</a>.</p>

      <p>This document began life as <cite>Tomcat: A Minimalistic User's
      Guide</cite> by Gal Shachor, and has been revised by many others.
      It should be considered a <strong>work in progress</strong>.  Since the
      Tomcat source tree is constantly changing, the information
      herein may be out of date.  The only definitive reference at
      this point is the <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.html">source
      code</a>.</p>

    <p>&quot;???&quot; means I'm not sure if this should go in, or

<dl>
	<dt><strong><a name="what_is_tomcat">What is Tomcat?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>Tomcat is the official reference implementation of the <a
		href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Java
		Servlet 2.2</a> and <a
		href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">JavaServer
		Pages 1.1</a> technologies. Developed under the Apache
		license in an open and participatory environment, it is
		intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed
		developers from around the world.</dd>

	<dt><strong><a name="where_download">Where can I download
		Tomcat?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>At the <a
		href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html">Jakarta
		download page</a>!</dd>

	<dt><strong><a name="what_servlets_jsps">What are servlets? What
		are JSPs?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>In a nutshell, servlets are memory-resident Java programs,
		running inside a servlet container (<em>e.g.,</em>
		Tomcat!). Because they're memory-resident, they can
		quickly respond to requests, as they do not incur the
		overhead of process creation and subsequent cleanup,
		unlike CGI-based scripting, e.g. perl, etc.
      
		<p>From <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Sun's
      servlet site</a>:</p>
    
		<blockquote>&quot;The <strong>Java<sup><font
			size="-2">TM</font></sup> Servlet API</strong>
			provides web developers with a simple,
			consistent mechanism for extending the
			functionality of a web server and for accessing
			existing business systems. A servlet can almost
			be thought of as an applet that runs on the
			server side -- without a face.&quot;</blockquote>

		<p>...and about JSPs (JavaServer Pages), again from <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Sun's
			servlet site</a>:</p>

		<blockquote>&quot;JSP technology is an extension of the
			servlet technology created to support authoring
			of HTML and XML pages. It makes it easier to
			combine fixed or static template data with
			dynamic content.&quot;</blockquote>

		<p>JSP is comparable to other technologies such as PHP
			and ASP, which combine programming/scripting
			with a markup language like HTML. The key
			difference being the programming language of
			choice. For example, PHP uses a C/C++/Java
			hybrid, ASP uses VBScript, and JSP utilizes the
			full power of the Java programming language.
			There have been many comparisons of these
			technologies, and each has its place in the
			astute developer's toolbox.</p>

		<p>All of the above information is available at <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's Java
			website</a>, which is a starting place for all
			the ins and outs of JSPs, servlets, etc.
			<strong>Your time spent with these technologies
			will be much more rewarding if you first read
			through the <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/download.html">JavaServer
			Pages</a> and <a

<h2><a name="using_tomcat">Using Tomcat 3.3</a></h2>

<p>A lot of effort has put into making Tomcat easy to use as well as flexible.
It comes with a default configuration which should be a good starting point
for most users.  Once you have Tomcat 3.3 up and running, there are many
customizations from which you can choose.</p>

<p>To help identify which version of Tomcat you have, a &quot;version&quot;
name has been incorporated in a number of places.  It is in the name of
the binary and source archives as well as the directory to which the archives
expand. <i>&lt;version&gt;</i> will appear in the text below where this
&quot;version&quot; name apears. The version will be &quot;3.3&quot; for the
initial Tomcat 3.3 release, and &quot;3.3.<i>x</i>&quot; for subsequent
maintenance releases.</p>

<h3><a name="install_tomcat">Installing Tomcat</a></h3>

<p>This section deals will installing the Tomcat 3.3 binary archive available
from the Jakarta Project.  It is also possible to install Tomcat 3.3 by
building it from source, but that isn't covered in this document.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html">Download</a> the
    appropriate jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i> binary archive file.</li>
    <br><br>

  <li>Expand the archive into some directory (say /usr/local or C:\). This
      should create a new subdirectory named
      <code>&quot;jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>&quot;</code>. You may
      rename this directory if you wish.  Just remember to adjust
      the instructions that follow to use the new name.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="env_setup">Environment Setup</a></h3>

<p>There are a number of different methods to start and stop Tomcat 3.3. There
are differences in the environmental setup needed for these methods. This
section addresses the environmental setup need to using the shell scripts
and batch files provided to simplify starting and stopping Tomcat.  This
section also assumes you will be manually starting and stopping Tomcat from
as shell or MS_DOS window.</p>
      
<ul>
  <li>In a shell or DOS window, change to the
      <code>&quot;jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>&quot;</code> directory.</li>
      <br><br>

  <li>Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to the root
      directory of your JDK hierarchy.  You may optionally add the Java
      interpreter to your PATH environment variable. The exact directory
      may vary from system to system. Check your local file system to be sure
      where Java is installed.
      <br><br>
	<ol>
  	<li>Win32:<br>
      	<tt><big>
      	set JAVA_HOME=c:/jdk1.3.1<br>
      	set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
      	</big></tt>
      	</li>
  	<li>Unix (bash/sh):<br>
      	<tt><big>
      	JAVA_HOME=/user/local/java/jdk1.3.1; export JAVA_HOME<br>
      	PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH<br>
      	</big></tt>
      	</li>
  	<li>Unix (tcsh):<br>
      	<tt><big>
      	setenv JAVA_HOME=/user/local/java/jdk1.3.1<br>
      	setenv PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH<br>
      	</big></tt>
      	</li>
	</ol></li>
    <br><br>

  <li>You may optionally set the TOMCAT_HOME environment variable.  If
      the supplied shell/batch scripts are executed from
      <tt>&quot;jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>&quot;</tt> or from
      its &quot;bin&quot; subdirectory, then they will successfully set
      TOMCAT_HOME for you if not already set.  If you wish to execute
      these shell/batch scripts from other directories, you must set
      TOMCAT_HOME explicitely.
      <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>On Win32 systems you should type: <br>
          <tt><big>set TOMCAT_HOME=c:\jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>
          </big></tt></li>
      <li>On UNIX (using bash/sh) you should type: <br>
          <tt><big>TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i> ; export TOMCAT_HOME
          </big></tt></li>
      <li>On UNIX (using tcsh) you should type: <br>
          <tt><big>setenv TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>
          </big></tt></li>
    </ol></li>
    <br><br>
    
  <li><a name="out_of_env"></a>If you are using Win9x, you will need to deal
      with the potential <b>&quot;Out of environment space&quot;</b> problem, if you
      haven't already. In the standard installation of Win9x, the deafault
      amount of environment space provided to MS-DOS windows is to small for
      Tomcat's batch files to run.  There are several ways to increase the
      size of the environment space.
      <br><br>      
    <ol>
      <li>A global solution is to add a &quot;SHELL&quot; command to your
          <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file.  Click Start -> Run and
          enter <code>sysedit</code>.  Then click OK.  In the
          <code>C:\CONFIG.SYS</code> window, add the line:
          <pre>SHELL=C:\COMMAND.COM /E:4096 /P</pre>
          and click File -> Save.  Then click File -> Exit and
          reboot your system. The default amount of environment space will
          now be 4096 bytes, more than enough for Tomcat.</li>
      <li>If you plan on always starting Tomcat 3.3 from the
          &quot;MS-DOS Prompt&quot;, open a &quot;MS-DOS Prompt&quot;.
          Right click on the icon in the upper left corner of the DOS
          window and select Properties.  In this dialog, select the Memory
          tab and change the &quot;Initial environment:&quot; setting
          to 4096.  Click OK and close the MS-DOS window. Now, whenever you
          open an &quot;MS-DOS Prompt&quot;, you will have enough environment
          space to start and stop Tomcat.</li>
      <li>If you like double-clicking files in Windows Explorer to run them,
          you can execute <code>sysedit</code> as described in the first
          method and add the <code>&quot;set JAVA_HOME ...&quot;</code> line
          from above to the <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> file.  Next in Windows
          Explorer, navigate to Tomcat's <code>bin</code> directory.  Right
          click on the <code>startup.bat</code> file and select Properties.
          Set the &quot;Inital environment:&quot; as described in the second
          method. Also select the Program tab and check the &quot;Close on
          exit&quot; option. Repeat this procedure for the <code>shutdown.bat</code>
          file. Reboot the system so the change to the <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>
          file can take effect.  Now you should be able to double-click
          on the <code>startup.bat</code> and <code>shutdown.bat</code> files
          in Windows Explorer to start and stop Tomcat.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you're sure they work, you may wish to set the environment
variables in a config file: C:/AUTOEXEC.BAT for Windows, ~/.bash_profile
or ~/.cshrc, etc.  Alternatively, you could customize Tomcats script or
batch files to encorporate the environment settings.</p>
	  
<h3><a name="starting_tomcat">Starting Tomcat</a></h3>

<p>Assuming you have opened a shell or MS-DOS window and set the environment
as described in the prior section, you are now ready to start and later
stop Tomcat 3.3.</p>

<p>To start Tomcat 3.3, execute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On UNIX: bin/startup.sh</li>
  <li>On Win32: bin\startup</li>
</ul>

<p>This will start Tomcat 3.3 in the background on Unix based systems, or in
a new MS-DOS window on Windows based systems.  If you are using Win9x, and
you see &quot;Out of environment space&quot;, double check your setup for
the last item in the prior section.</p>

<p>You will need to wait a short period of time before Tomcat 3.3 is ready
to serve requests. The very first use will need a little extra time since
some WAR files will be expanded by default.</p>

<p>You can tell when Tomcat 3.3 has completed its startup when text like the
following appears in the log output.</p>
<pre>
2001-09-01 14:23:30 - Http10Interceptor: Starting on 8080
2001-09-01 14:23:30 - Ajp12Interceptor: Starting on 8007
2001-09-01 14:23:30 - Ajp13Interceptor: Starting on 8009
</pre>

<p>In Tomcat's default configuration, Tomcat's output log is not assigned to
a file.  Instead, Tomcat's log output goes <code>stderr</code>.  On Windows
systems, you can switch to the MS-DOS window to see if this test has
appeared.</p>

<p>As you might quess from the above log text, default Tomcat 3.3 configuration
will service HTTP requests on port 8080.  If you start your browser and open
<a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> you will see Tomcat
3.3's Welcome page.</p>

<p>In addition to serving HTTP, the default configuration will service Ajp12
protocol requests on port 8007 and Ajp13 protocol requests on 8009. These
protocols are used by the &quot;connectors&quot; which allow Tomcat to be used
as a Servlet/JSP container for an external web server, such as Apache. Also,
the Ajp12 protocol is used by the Tomcat shutdown process.</p>

<p>Though documented below, here are a couple of items that you may find
useful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may pass options and system property settings to the Java VM by
      specifying them in an environment variable called TOMCAT_OPTS.<br>
      <b>Note:</b> On Win9x, you will not be able so include system property
      settings in TOMCAT_OPTS because the <code>SET</code> command won't
      accept a line with more than one equals sign.</li>
  <li>The &quot;auto-generated&quot; configuration files for external web
      servers, such as Apache, are not written during a normal startup of
      Tomcat.  To write the configuration files, append <code>jkconf</code>
      to the startup command. Tomcat will initialize sufficiently to write
      the files and then exit.  This may be done while the Tomcat 3.3 is
      runing as a web server. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="stopping_tomcat">Stopping Tomcat</a></h3>

<p>To perform a normal shutdown of Tomcat 3.3, a special &quot;shutdown&quot;
request must be send from a separate process, or possibly a different computer.
In the default configuration, that &quot;shutdown&quot; request must be made
using the Ajp12 protocol. If the shell or MS-DOS window used to start Tomcat
is not still open, first open a new one and set the environment the same as for
starting Tomcat.</p>

<p>To stop Tomcat 3.3, execute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On UNIX: bin/shutdown.sh</li>
  <li>On Win32: bin\shutdown</li>
</ul>

<p>The shutdown process incorportates a <code>host</code>, <code>port</code>,
and a <code>password</code>. In the default configuration, the <code>host</code>
defaults to <code>localhost</code>. This means that Tomcat 3.3 can only be
shutdown from the same computer that started it.  The <code>port</code>
automatically defaults to the port being used by the Ajp12 protocol. The
<code>password</code> defaults to &quot;not specified&quot;. This means that
a password will not be required to shutdown Tomcat 3.3.</p>
  
<h3><a name="tomcat_scripts">Tomcat Shell and Batch Files</a></h3>

<p>Tomcat's shell and batch files are found in Tomcat's <code>bin</code>
directory. These files support &quot;actions&quot; beyond starting and
stopping Tomcat. To help make better use of the functionality provided, the
following table describes each of these files. If desired, you can customize
these batch files to suit your needs.</p>

<h4>Tomcat Shell and Batch files</h4>
<table border="1">
  <tr><th bgcolor="#c0c0c0">File</th><th bgcolor="#c0c0c0">Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>cpappend.bat</td><td>This batch file is used by <code>tomcat.bat</code>

<p>You may have noted that <code>tomcat.sh</code> and <code>tomcat.bat</code>
are the primary scripts. They are the scripts that actually perform the
&quot;actions&quot;. The list of actions, as well as additional environment
variables, they support is described in the
<a href="#tomcat_actions">next section</a>.</p>

<p>Note that most actions involve starting the
<code>org.apache.tomcat.startup.Main</code> class in a Java VM. This class
and some classes it uses also accept arguments. To take advantage of the
full capabilities of Tomcat, you will need to become familiar with these
arguments as will. See <a href="main_args">Tomcat's Main class arguments</a>
for those details.</p>

<h3><a name="tomcat_actions">tomcat.sh/tomcat.bat Actions</a></h3>

<p>The <code>tomcat.sh</code> shell script and <code>tomcat.bat</code> batch
files contain the code that invokes the various features of Tomcat 3.3.  It
supports a number of actions specified by the first argument.  The following
table lists the supported actions. Almost all of the actions involve starting
a Java VM.  An environment variable, TOMCAT_OPTS or JSPC_OPTS, is provided for
specifying Java VM options, such as &quot;-Xmx256m&quot; and system property
settings, such as &quot;-Dmy.prop=myvalue&quot;. The <code>jspc</code> action
uses the <code>JSPC_OPTS</code> environment variable.  All other actions with
support this environment variable use <code>TOMCAT_OPTS</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> On Win9x, you will not be able to include system property
settings in <code>TOMCAT_OPTS</code> or <code>JSPC_OPTS</code> because the
<code>SET</code> command will not accept a line with more than one equals
sign. If you need an additional system property setting, you will need to
modify your <code>tomcat.bat</code> to include it on the command line.</p>

<h4>Actions supported by the tomcat.sh and tomcat.bat scripts</h4>
<table border="1">
  <tr><th bgcolor="#c0c0c0">Action</th><th bgcolor="#c0c0c0">Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>start</td><td>This action starts up Tomcat in the background on Unix
    based systems, and in a new MS-DOS window on Windows based systems.
    Java VM options may be specified in the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>stop</td><td>This actions tries to stop the running Tomcat. Java VM
    options may be specified in the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>run</td><td>This action starts up Tomcat in the foreground on Unix
    based systems, and in the current MS-DOS window on Windows based systems.
    Java VM options may be specified in the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>enableAdmin</td><td>Rewrites the <code>apps-admin.xml</code> file in
    Tomcat's <code>conf</code> directory so that the admin web application is
    &quot;trusted&quot;.  For security reasons, the admin web application is
    &quot;untrusted&quot; by default. If you plan to leave the admin web
    application trusted, you should change the admin password found in the
    <code>admin-users.xml</code> file in the <code>conf/users</code> directory.
    Java VM options may be specified in the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>env</td><td>Sets the TOMCAT_HOME and CLASSPATH environment variables
    to match Tomcat's runtime environment.  This is useful for compiling
    servlets or other Java files for use within Tomcat. For best results, insure
    TOMCAT_HOME is set to an absolute path.  If set to &quot;.&quot;
    or &quot;..&quot;, the CLASSPATH environment variable will be invalid if
    you leave the current directory.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>jspc</td><td>Pre-translates specified JSP pages to Java files.
    Java VM options may be specified in the JSPC_OPTS environment variable.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>estart</td><td>Starts Tomcat without reading the server.xml file.
    Instead the set of modules make up the instance of Tomcat is created
    internally by org.apache.tomcat.startup.EmbeddedTomcat. This command is
    usefull for testing customized versions of the EmbeddedTomcat class when
    trying to embed Tomcat in an application. Java VM options may be specified
    in the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Except for the <code>env</code> action, each action corresponds to a
&quot;task&quot; supported by the <code>org.apache.tomcat.startup.Main</code>
class. The <code>tomcat.sh</code> and <code>tomcat.bat</code> files, as well
as the files that call them, will pass additional arguments on the command line
to the <code>Main</code> class as arguments. See the next section for what
arguments are supported by each of the tasks.</p>

<p>Also note that the TOMCAT_HOME environment variable is passed to the
startup class via a <code>tomcat.home</code> system property.</p>

<h3><a name="tomcat_task_args">Tomcat Task Arguments</a></h3>

<p>The <code>org.apache.tomcat.startup.Main</code> class is the primary class
used for executing a Tomcat &quot;task&quot;, i.e. start, stop, etc. The term
&quot;task&quot; is used instead of &quot;action&quot; because it is more than
just an argument here. Each task has an associated class which will be executed
to perform the task. The first argument passed to the <code>main()</code>
method of <code>org.apache.tomcat.startup.Main</code> will determine which
&quot;task&quot; class gets executed. Each of the &quot;task&quot; classes
supports its own set of arguments.  These arguments are documented in the
table that follows.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The arguments to each of the tasks may be optionally preceded
by a '-'. However, the &quot;task&quot; argument must not be preceded by a '-'.
If you specified <code>-stop</code> as the task, the default &quot;start&quot;
task would be executed and <code>-stop</code> passed to the &quot;start&quot;
task as an argument.</p>

<p>In this classloader hierarchy, classloaders can access classes in
classloaders beneath them. They can not access classes in classloaders to the
side or above! With this in mind, a brief inspection should reveal that in
Tomcat 3.3, web applications do not have access to an XML parser by default.
The <code>jaxp.jar</code> and <code>crimson.jar</code> are tucked away in the
<b>Server Classloader</b> where they are accessible only within that classloader.</p>

<p>Also note that if you have a jar containing classes which depends on
<code>servlet.jar</code>, putting it on the CLASSPATH wouldn't work.
<code>servlet.jar</code> isn't accessible to the <b>Application Classloader</b>.
This is why in Tomcat 3.3, your CLASSPATH envronment variable is ignored.  You
must put such a jar in the <b>Common Classloader</b> or above.</p>

<p>For classes to are used solely by a web application, they should be placed
in the web application's <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> or in a jar in the
<code>WEB-INF/lib</code> as defined by the Servlet 2.2 specifications.  If you
want to give the classes wider scope, place the classes in a jar if they aren't
already.  Then place the jar in the directory that corresponds to the
classloader with the scope you desired.  In the <b>Apps Classloader</b>, the
classes are shared among all the web applications.  In the <b>Common Classloader</b>,
the classes are shared among all the web applications and the web server classes.</p>

<p>A second method is available for adding classes to the <b>Common Classloader</b>
and <b>Apps Classloader</b>.  Entries found in an <code>org.apache.tomcat.common.classpath</code>
system property are added to the <b>Common Classloader</b> and entries found in
an <code>org.apache.tomcat.apps.classpath</code> are added to the <b>Apps CLassloader</b>.</p>

<h3><a name="configuring_server">Configuring the Server</a></h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>By default, Tomcat's configuration is determined by the contents of the
<code>server.xml</code> file found in Tomcat's <code>conf</code> directory.
This file specifies the sequence of <strong>modules</strong> (a.k.a. interceptors)
that should participate in the operation of this instance of Tomcat.  This file
also includes the operating parameters for those modules.</p>

<p>Prior to reading the <code>server.xml</code> file, Tomcat reads the
<code>modules.xml</code> file which is also found in the <code>conf</code>
directory.  This file specifies mappings between module names and the class
that implements the module.  This simplifies the syntax in <code>servers.xml</code>
and allows you to update a module's class by updating just <code>modules.xml</code>.
The <code>server.xml</code>, and possibly other files, do not have to change.</p>

<p>To allow for customization of Tomcat's configuration without requiring
modification of <code>modules.xml</code> and <code>server.xml</code>, Tomcat
will read additional files during startup.  In addition to <code>modules.xml</code>,
Tomcat will read any file in the <code>conf</code> directory that matches the
pattern <code>modules-*.xml</code>.  Likewise for <code>server.xml</code>,
by default Tomcat will read additional files which match the pattern
<code>server-*.xml</code>.</p>

<p>If you specify the configuration file (i.e. the file to use in place of
<code>server.xml</code>) as a command line argument, the additional files read
will be derived from the base name of the file you specify.  For example, if
the configuration file specified was <code>myserver.xml</code>, then the file
pattern would be <code>myserver-*.xml</code>.  Because of this, you should avoid
using '-' in your configuration file names except when taking advantage of this
feature.</p>

<p>When using additional configuration files in conjunction with
<code>server.xml</code> it is important to note that these configuration files
apply to a single Tomcat 3.3 server instance.  In other words, all
&lt;ContextManager&gt; elements in these files refer to the same ContextManager
instance. ContextManager is the controlling class for the Tomcat 3.3 server.</p>

<p>Other files may be read as well for configuration. These, however, are determined
by the <strong>modules</strong> that are included by <code>server.xml</code>
and associated files.  The primary example of this is <code>ContextXmlReader</code>.
It is responsible for reading files containing Context declarations in the form:</p>
<pre>&lt;Context path=&quot;myapp&quot; docBase=&quot;somepath&quot; ... /></pre> or 
<pre>&lt;Context path=&quot;myapp&quot; docBase=&quot;somepath&quot; ...&gt;
    <i>context local modules</i>
&lt;/Context&gt;</pre>

<p>By separating the reading of &quot;context&quot; configurations from the
server configuration, you can manually add additional contexts without
modifying the <code>server.xml</code> file.</p>

<p>The <code>ContextXmlReader</code> module supports a <code>config</code>
parameter which specifies the file to read.  Like <code>server.xml</code>,
additional files are read based on the pattern <code><i>base</i>-*.xml</code>.
Thus, specifying <code>config=&quot;conf/myapps.xml&quot;</code> would read
<code>conf/myapps.xml</code>, if it exists, plus all files in the
<code>conf</code> directory matching the pattern <code>myapps-*.xml</code>.</p>

<p>Tomcat 3.3's default <code>server.xml</code> includes two instances of the
<code>ContextXmlReader</code> module.  One reads <code>conf/apps.xml</code>,
which reads all the &quot;apps&quot; files found in the <code>conf</code>
directory by default.  For backward compatibility with having &quot;context&quot;
declarations in <code>server.xml</code>, the second instance of
<code>ContextXmlReader</code> reads <code>conf/server.xml</code>, processing
only the <code>&lt;Context&gt;</code> entries.</p>

<hr size="5">

<h3><a name="container_types">Servlet Container Types</a></h3>

<p>Tomcat, like any servlet container, is meant to run behind a web
    server.  The web server takes care of receiving HTTP requests from
    client browsers; the servlet container takes care of serving
    Servlets and JSPs for those URLs that request them.</p>
<p>In Tomcat's case, there are three different modes of execution

		case when using a Java-based web server, for example the
		servlet container that is part of the JavaWebServer.
		Stand-alone is the default mode used by Tomcat. Most web
		servers, however, are not Java-based, which leads us to
		the next two container types.</dd>
        
	<dt><strong>In-process servlet containers</strong></dt>
	<dd>The servlet container is a combination of a web server
		plugin and a Java container implementation. The web
		server plugin opens a JVM inside the web server's
		address space and lets the servlet container run in it.
		If a certain request should execute a servlet, the
		plugin takes control over the request and passes it
		(using <a
		href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/jni/index.html">JNI</a>)
		to the servlet container. An in-process container is
		suitable for multi-threaded single-process servers and
		provides good performance but is limited in
		scalability.</dd>
            
	<dt><strong>Out-of-process servlet containers</strong></dt>
	<dd>The servlet container is a combination of a web server
		plugin and a Java container implementation that runs in
		a JVM outside the web server. The web server plugin and
		the Java container JVM communicate using some IPC
		mechanism (usually TCP/IP sockets). If a certain request
		should execute a servlet the plugin takes control over
		the request and passes it (using IPC) to the servlet
		container. The response time of an out-of-process engine
		is not as good as in the in-process one but the
		out-of-process engine performs better in many measurable
		ways (scalability, stability, etc.).</dd>

    <p>Tomcat can be used as either a stand-alone container
      (mainly for development and debugging) or as an add-on to an
      existing web server (currently Apache, IIS and Netscape servers are 
      supported). This means that whenever you are deploying Tomcat you will 
      have to decide how to use it and, if you select options 2 or 3, you
      will also need to install a web server adapter.</p>

      <p>If this is your first time configuring Tomcat and you plan on integrating
      it with a web server, you're better off initially running it
      stand-alone. You'll be better able to isolate errors during
      integration with your web server when you do so in the future - &quot;Is
      Tomcat or my web server at fault for the error I'm seeing?&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="webapps">Deploying Web Applications</a></h2>

<h3>What is a Web Application?</h3>

<p>[??? - move this section up above the Configuring Tomcat section? It's
not clear whether we should teach about webapps before or after we
introduce server.xml et al.]</p>

<p>A Web Application (or &quot;webapp&quot;) is a concept that was introduced in
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.2/">Servlet
Specification</a> version 2.2. [2.1?] You should definitely read the
spec for the full story. From the spec (chapter 9):</p>

<!--[[blockquote]] not sure what the range of this quite is supposed to be-->
<p>A web application is a collection of servlets, html pages, classes, and other resources that can be
bundled and run on multiple containers from multiple vendors. A web application is rooted at a
specific path within a web server. For example, a catalog application could be located at http://
www.mycorp.com/catalog. All requests that start with this prefix will be routed to the
ServletContext which represents the catalog application.</p>

<p>A servlet container can also establish rules for automatic generation of web applications. For
example a ~user/ mapping could be used to map to a web application based at /home/user/
public_html/.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>A web application exists as a structured hierarchy of directories. The
root of this hierarchy serves as a document root for serving files
that are part of this context. For example, for a web application
located at /catalog in a web server, the index.html file located at
the base of the web application hierarchy can be served to satisfy a
request to /catalog/index.html.</p>

<p>A special directory exists within the application hierarchy named &quot;WEB-INF&quot;. This directory
contains all things related to the application that aren't in the document root of the application. It is
important to note that the WEB-INF node is not part of the public document tree of the application.
No file contained in the WEB-INF directory may be served directly to a client.</p>

<p>The contents of the WEB-INF directory are:</p>

<ul>
<li> /WEB-INF/web.xml deployment descriptor </li>
<li> /WEB-INF/classes/* directory for servlet and utility classes. The classes in this directory
are used by the application class loader to load classes from. </li>
<li> /WEB-INF/lib/*.jar area for Java ARchive files which contain servlets, beans, and other
utility classes useful to the web application. All such archive files are used by the web
application class loader to load classes from. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Web Application Directory Structure</h3>

<p>Illustrated here is a listing of all the files in a sample web application:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>/index.html
/howto.jsp
/feedback.jsp
/images/banner.gif
/images/jumping.gif
/WEB-INF/web.xml
/WEB-INF/lib/jspbean.jar
/WEB-INF/classes/com/mycorp/servlets/MyServlet.class
/WEB-INF/classes/com/mycorp/util/MyUtils.class
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can deploy a WAR file that is present on the local filesystem by
adding a &lt;Context&gt; tag to TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml. For
example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;Context path=&quot;/mywebapp&quot;
  docBase=&quot;/home/alex/webapps/mywebapp&quot;
  reloadable=&quot;true&quot; &gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h4><a name="what_is_war">What is a WAR file?</a></h4>

<p><em>&quot;WAR. Huh! What is it good for?&quot; - Edwin Starr</em></p>

<p>A WAR (or &quot;web archive&quot;) file is simply a packaged webapp directory.
It is created using the standard Java <tt><big>jar</big></tt> tool.
For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>cd /home/alex/webapps/mywebapp 
jar cf mywebapp.war *</pre></blockquote>

<h4><a name="deploying_war">Deploying WAR files in Tomcat</a></h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently (as of version 3.2) the procedure for deploying a new WAR file is:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Stop Tomcat.</strong></li>
	<li><p><strong>Delete existing deployment.</strong> If you have
		previously deployed &quot;foo.war&quot; in
		TOMCAT_HOME/webapps, then it has been unpacked into
		webapps/foo/...  You must delete this directory and all
		its contents. On Unix, this can be done with:</p>

		<pre>rm -r $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/foo</pre>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Copy WAR file to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Start Tomcat.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This process may become easier in the future. A &quot;deploy tool&quot; is on the Tomcat &quot;to-do&quot; list.</p>

<p>Note that if you deploy a WAR file in this manner, you do not need to
make any changes to <tt><big>server.xml</big></tt> -- it will 
automatically be recognized and activated when the server starts.
However, if you wish to specify non-default options for this webapp,
you may do so by adding an element like <tt><big>&lt;Context
docBase=&quot;webapps/foo&quot; ...</big></tt> to server.xml.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/view.jsp?EID=123229">How
do I deploy a WAR file in Tomcat?</a> in the jGuru FAQ.</p>

<h3><a name="tutorials">Tomcat Tutorials</a></h3>

<p>These tutorials will be run with the assumption that Tomcat
	is operating as a stand-alone container. Like we said
	before, it can be helpful to understand Tomcat's
	functionality, irrespective of the particular web server
	you're using. Trying to get more than one thing working
	at once usually leads to more problems than its worth.
	Integration will be covered later in subsequent
	sections.</p>

[Note: add some tutorials here :-) ]


<h2><a name="real_world_tips">Real World Configuration Tips</a></h2>

<p>By default the Tomcat distribution comes with a naive
	configuration whose main goal is to promote first time
	user experience and an &quot;out of the box&quot; operation...
	This configuration however is not the best way to deploy
	Tomcat on real sites. For example, real sites may
	require some performance tuning and site-specific
	settings (additional path elements for example). This
	section will try to get you started by directing you to
	the first steps that should be taken before publishing a
	Tomcat based site.</p>

<h3>Modify and Customize the Batch Files</h3>
<p>As stated in the previous sections, the startup scripts are
	here for your convenience.  Yet, sometimes the scripts
	that are needed for deployment should be modified:</p>

<ul>
            <li> To set resource limits such as maximum number of
                 descriptors. </li>
            <li> To add new CLASSPATH entries (for example, JDBC drivers). </li>
            <li> To add new PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH entries (for example, JDBC
                 drivers DLLs). </li>
            <li> To modify the JVM command line settings. </li>
            <li> Make sure that you are using a specific JVM (out of the two
                 or three JVMs installed on your machine). </li>
            <li> To switch user from root to some other user using the &quot;su&quot;
                 UNIX command. </li>
            <li> Your pet reason. </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these changes can be done without explicit changes to
	the basic scripts; for example, the tomcat script can
	use an environment variable named <tt>TOMCAT_OPTS</tt>
	to set extra command line parameters to the JVM (such as
	memory setting etc.). On <em>UNIX</em> you can also
	create a file named <tt>&quot;.tomcatrc&quot;</tt> in your home
	directory and Tomcat will take environment information
	such as PATH, JAVA_HOME, TOMCAT_HOME and CLASSPATH from
	this file. On NT however (and also on UNIX when the
	modifications are for something such as the JVM command
	line) you are forced to rewrite some of the startup
	script...</p>

<div><strong>Do not hesitate, just do it.</strong></div>

<h3>Modify the Default JVM Settings</h3>

<p>The default JVM settings in the tomcat script are very
	na&iuml;ve; everything is left for defaults. There are a
	few things that you should consider to improve your
	Tomcat performance:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Modify your JVM memory configuration. Normally the JVM
           allocates an initial size for the Java heap and that's it, if
           you need more then this amount of memory you will not get it.<br>
           Nevertheless, in loaded sites, giving more memory to the JVM
           improves Tomcat's performance. You should use command line
           parameters such as -Xms/-Xmx/-ms/-mx to set the minimum/maximum
           size of the Java heap (and check to see if the performance was
           improved). </li>

            <li> Modify your JVM threading configuration. The SUN JDK1.2.2 for
           Linux comes with support for both, green and native threads. In
           general native threads are known to provide improved performance
           for I/O bound applications, green threads on the other hand put
           less stress on the machine. You should experiment with these two
           threading models and see which model is better for your site (in
           general, native threads are better).</li>

            <li> Select the best JVM for the task. There are several JVM vendors,
           for example on Linux there are today (21/03/2000) two product level
           JVMs: the SUN JDK1.2.2 and the IBM JDK1.1.8. If your application
           does not require a specific JDK functionality, you should
           benchmark the two JVMs and select the better one. In my (Gal
           Shachor) internal tests I found the IBM JVM significantly faster
           than the one created by SUN, you should check that for yourself
           and make a calculated decision.
           </li>
        </ol>


<h3>Modify your Connectors</h3>

    <p>
        The Connectors, as configured in Tomcat's default server.xml
        contains two Connectors configured as in the next server.xml
        fragment:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" valign="center">
	<caption><em>The two default Connectors in server.xml</em></caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<pre>
        &lt;!-- (1) HTTP Connector for stand-alone operation --&gt;
        &lt;Http10Connector port=&quot;8080&quot;
                         address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
        /&gt;

        &lt;!-- (2) AJPV12 Connector for out-of-process operation --&gt;
        &lt;Ajp12Connector port=&quot;8007&quot;
                        address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
        /&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
</table>

<ol>
            <li> Is a Connector that listens on port 8080 for incoming HTTP
                 requests. This connector is needed for stand-alone
                 operation.</li>
            <li> Is a Connector that listens on port 8007 for incoming AJPV12
                 requests. This connector is needed for web-server
                 integration (out-of-process servlet integration).</li>
        </ol>

<p>It is clear that a sane Tomcat deployment will use either an
        out-of-process servlet integration or a stand-alone operation,
        removing the unnecessary Connector is important.</p>


<h3>Use a Thread Pool in your Connectors</h3>

    <p>
        Tomcat is a multi-threaded servlet container this means that each
        request needs to be executed by some thread. By default when a
        request arrives Tomcat creates a new thread, starts it and has it
        serve the request. This behavior is problematic for loaded sites
        because:</p>

<ul>
            <li>Starting and stopping a thread  for every request puts a
                needless burden on the operating system and the JVM.</li>
            <li>It is hard to limit the resource consumption. If 300
                requests arrive concurrently Tomcat will open 300
                threads to serve them and allocate all the resources needed
                to serve all the 300 requests at the same time.  This causes
                Tomcat to allocate much more resources (CPU, Memory,
                Descriptors...) than it should and it can lead to low
                performance and even crashes if resources are exhausted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution for these problems is to use a <strong>thread pool</strong>.
        Servlet containers that are using a thread pool relieve themselves
        from directly managing their threads. Instead of allocating new
        threads; whenever they need a thread they ask for it from the pool,
        and when they are done, the thread is returned to the pool. The
        thread pool can now be used to implement sophisticated thread
        management techniques, such as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Keeping threads &quot;open&quot; and reusing them over and over
                 again. This saves the trouble associated with creating and 
				 destroying threads continuously.
	<ul>
		<li>Usually the administrator can instruct the pool not to keep too many idle threads, freeing them if needed.</li>
	</ul>
            </li>

	<li>Setting an upper bound on the number of threads used
                 concurrently. This prevents the resources allocation
                 problem associated with unlimited thread allocation.
	<ul>
		<li>If the container maxed out to the threads upper limit, and a new
                 request arrives, the new request will have to wait for
                 some other (previous) request to finish and free the thread
                 used to service it.</li>
	</ul>
            </li>
</ol>

<p>You can refine the techniques described above in various ways, but
        these are only refinements. The main contribution of thread pools is
        thread-reuse and having a concurrency upper bound that limits
        resource usage.</p>

    <p>
        Using a thread pool in Tomcat is a simple move; all you need to do
        is to use a <tt>PoolTcpConnector</tt> in your &lt;Connector&gt;
        configuration. For example the following server.xml fragment defines
        ajpv12, pooled Connector:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" valign="middle">
	<caption><em>Pooled ajpv12 Connector</em></caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<pre>
        &lt;!-- A pooled AJPV12 Connector for out-of-process operation --&gt;
        &lt;Ajp12Connector port=&quot;8007&quot;
                        address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
        /&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
</table>

<p>This fragment is very simple and the (default) pool behaviour
        instructed by it is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Upper bound for concurrency of 50 threads. </li>
            <li> When the pool has more then 25 threads standing idle it
                 will start to kill them. </li>
            <li> The pool will start 10 threads on creation, and it will try
                 to keep 10 vacant threads (as long as the upper bound is
                 kept). </li>
        </ul>
<p>The default configuration is suitable for medium load sites with an
   average of 10-40 concurrent requests. If your site differs you
   should modify this configuration (for example reduce the upper
   limit). Configuring the pool can be done through the &lt;Connector&gt;
   element in server.xml as demonstrated in the next fragment:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" valign="middle">
	<caption><em>Configuring the Thread Pool</em></caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<pre>
        &lt;!-- A pooled AJPV12 Connector for out-of-process operation --&gt;
        &lt;Ajp12Connector tomcatAuthentication=&quot;false&quot;
                        port=&quot;8007&quot;
                        address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
                        maxThreads=&quot;30&quot;
                        maxSpareThreads=&quot;20&quot;
                        minSpareThreads=&quot;5&quot;
        /&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
</table>

<p>As can be seen the pool has 3 configuration parameters:</p>

<ul>
            <li> maxThreads - defines the upper bound to the for the 
			     concurrency, the pool will not create more then this number 
				 of threads. </li>
            <li> maxSpareThreads - defines the maximum number of threads
                 that the pool will keep idle. If the number of idle threads
                 passes the value of max_spare_threads the pool will kill
                 these threads. </li>
            <li> minSpareThreads - the pool will try to make sure that at
                 any time there is at least this number of idle threads
                 waiting for new requests to arrive. min_spare_threads must
                 be bigger then 0.</li>
        </ul>

        You should use the above parameters to adjust the pool behavior to
        your needs.


<h3>Disable Servlet Auto-Reloading</h3>

    <p>
        Servlet auto-reloading is really useful for development time.
        However it is very expensive (in performance degradation terms) and
        may put your application in strange conflicts when classes that were
        loaded by a certain classloader cannot co-operate with classes
        loaded by the current classloader.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, unless you have a real need for class reloading during your
        deployment you should turn off the reloadable flag in your contexts.
    </p>

<h3>Start Tomcat from /etc/inittab</h3>

    <p>
        Unfortunately the adapters developed for Apache (or for any of the
        other servers) cannot start Tomcat yet. On UNIX however, you can
        use the init table to start Tomcat automatically upon machine
        startup. FIXME:
    </p>

<H1>Tomcat User's Guide</H1>

<p>This document is an introduction to the Tomcat servlet
	container. It should be enough for anyone to install,
	configure, and deploy Tomcat. As well, it answers many
	questions common to new users. We encourage all users to
	add answers to questions into the <a
	href="http://jakarta.apache.org/faq/faqindex.html">
	Tomcat FAQ</a> and/or this document, if they don't
	already exist. If you have any comments or suggestions
	about this document don't hesitate to send them to the
	Tomcat <a
	href="http://jakarta.apache.org/getinvolved/mail.html">mailing
	lists</a>.</p>

      <p>This document began life as <cite>Tomcat: A Minimalistic User's
      Guide</cite> by Gal Shachor, and has been revised by many others.
      It should be considered a <strong>work in progress</strong>.  Since the
      Tomcat source tree is constantly changing, the information
      herein may be out of date.  The only definitive reference at
      this point is the <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/sourceindex.html">source
      code</a>.</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong><a name="what_is_tomcat">What is Tomcat?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>Tomcat is the official reference implementation of the <a
		href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Java
		Servlet 2.2</a> and <a
		href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">JavaServer
		Pages 1.1</a> technologies. Developed under the Apache
		license in an open and participatory environment, it is
		intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed
		developers from around the world.</dd>

	<dt><strong><a name="where_download">Where can I download
		Tomcat?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>At the <a
		href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">Jakarta
		download page</a>!</dd>

	<dt><strong><a name="just_jserv">Isn't Tomcat just
		JServ?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>This is a common misunderstanding. <a
		href="http://java.apache.org/jserv">JServ</a> is a
		Servlet API 2.0-compliant container that was created to
		be used with Apache. Tomcat is a complete re-write and
		is a Servlet API 2.2 and JSP 1.1-compliant container.
		Tomcat uses some of the code written for JServ,
		especially JServ's Apache server adapter, but this is
		where the similarities end.</dd>
	<dt><strong><a name="what_servlets_jsps">What are servlets? What
		are JSPs?</a></strong></dt>
	<dd>In a nutshell, servlets are memory-resident Java programs,
		running inside a servlet container (<em>e.g.,</em>
		Tomcat!). Because they're memory-resident, they can
		quickly respond to requests, as they do not incur the
		overhead of process creation and subsequent cleanup,
		unlike CGI-based scripting, e.g. perl, etc.
      
		<p>From <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Sun's
      servlet site</a>:
    
		<blockquote>&quot;The <strong>Java<sup><font
			size="-2">TM</font></sup> Servlet API</strong>
			provides web developers with a simple,
			consistent mechanism for extending the
			functionality of a web server and for accessing
			existing business systems. A servlet can almost
			be thought of as an applet that runs on the
			server side -- without a face.&quot;</blockquote>

		<p>...and about JSPs (JavaServer Pages), again from <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Sun's
			servlet site</a>:</p>

		<blockquote>&quot;JSP technology is an extension of the
			servlet technology created to support authoring
			of HTML and XML pages. It makes it easier to
			combine fixed or static template data with
			dynamic content.&quot;</blockquote>

		<p>JSP is comparable to other technologies such as PHP
			and ASP, which combine programming/scripting
			with a markup language like HTML. The key
			difference being the programming language of
			choice. For example, PHP uses a C/C++/Java
			hybrid, ASP uses VBScript, and JSP utilizes the
			full power of the Java programming language.
			There have been many comparisons of these
			technologies, and each has its place in the
			astute developer's toolbox.</p>

		<p>All of the above information is available at <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's Java
			website</a>, which is a starting place for all
			the ins and outs of JSPs, servlets, etc.
			<strong>Your time spent with these technologies
			will be much more rewarding if you first read
			through the <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/download.html">JavaServer
			Pages</a> and <a
			href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html">servlet</a>

<h4><a name="starting_another_dir">Starting multiple instances with
    	individual server.xml files</a></h4>

    <blockquote>
    
    <p>This might not make a whole lot of sense until you read the next section
    explaining Tomcat's <a href="#directory_structure">directory structure</a>,
    as well as <a href="#configuring_tomcat">Configuring Tomcat</a>. You
    may want to come back here afterwards.</p>
    
    <p>By default, Tomcat will use TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml for
    configuration, which by default, uses TOMCAT_HOME as its base for the contexts.
    You can change this by using the "-f /path/to/server.xml" option, with a
       different server configuration file and setting the home attribute of
       the <a href="#context_manager_element">ContextManager</a> element. You need to set up the required files inside the
       home:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>webapps/ - all war files will
              be expanded and all subdirectories added as contexts.</li>
          <li>conf/ directory - you can store a special web.xml and other
              configuration files.</li>
          <li>logs/ - all logs will go to this directory instead of the main
              TOMCAT_HOME/logs/.</li>
          <li>work/ - work directories for the contexts.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <p>If the home attribute of the ContextManager element in server.xml is relative, it
       will be relative to the current working directory.</p>

<h4><a name="directory_structure">The Tomcat directory structure</a></h4>

          Tomcat.).
        </td>

</blockquote>

	<h4><a name="tomcat_scripts">Tomcat scripts</a></h4>
    <p>This section is not required reading, as the default functionality
    provided by the aforementioned startup and shutdown scripts is sufficient
    for most users to get started. If everything is working so far, skip ahead to <a href="#configuring_tomcat">Configuring
    Tomcat</a>. Come back to this section when you'd like more information
    on these scripts, which you undoubtedly will.</p>

    <p>Tomcat is a Java program, and therefore it is possible to execute
       it from the command line, after setting several environment 
       variables. However, setting each environment variable and following 
       the command line parameters used by Tomcat is error prone and 
       tedious. Instead, the Tomcat development team provides a few scripts 
       to ease starting and stopping Tomcat.</p>

<p><strong>Note: The scripts are only a convenient way to start/stop.
	You can modify them to customize the CLASSPATH, environment
        variables such as PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc., so long as a
	correct command line is generated for Tomcat.</strong></p>

    <p>The following table presents the scripts that are
      most important for the common user:</p>

<table border=1 width="75%" valign="MIDDLE">
      <tr>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="15%"> Script name </th>
        <th bgcolor="#c0c0c0" width="85%"> Description </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="15%" align="center"> tomcat </td>
        <td width="85%"> The main script. Sets the proper environment, including
          CLASSPATH, TOMCAT_HOME and JAVA_HOME, and starts Tomcat with
          the proper command line parameters.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="15%" align="center"> startup </td>
        <td width="85%"> Starts tomcat in the background. Shortcut for "tomcat start" </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="15%" align="center"> shutdown </td>
        <td width="85%"> Stops tomcat (shutting it down). Shortcut for "tomcat stop" </td>
      </tr>
</table>

    <p>The script which has the most significance for users is tomcat
       (tomcat.sh/tomcat.bat). The other Tomcat related scripts serve as a
       simplified single-task oriented entry point to the tomcat script (set
       different command line parameters etc.).</p>

<h4><a name="tomcat_scripts_closer">Tomcat scripts: a closer look</a></h4>

    <p>A closer look at tomcat.sh/tomcat.bat yields that it performs the
      following actions:</p>

      <p>These behaviors, especially CLASSPATH setting, have changed
      with Tomcat 3.2.  It is best to look directly at the scripts for
      details on what variables are set and what class files are
      loaded. [??? - delete entire section pending reexamination?]</p>

<h3><a name="container_types">Servlet Container Types</a></h3>

<p>Tomcat, like any servlet container, is meant to run behind a web
    server.  The web server takes care of receiving HTTP requests from
    client browsers; the servlet container takes care of serving
    Servlets and JSPs for those URLs that request them.</p>
<p>In Tomcat's case, there are three different modes of execution
    Tomcat supports.</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong><a name="type_1">Stand-alone servlet containers</a></strong>
	<dd>These are an integral part of the web server. This is the
		case when using a Java-based web server, for example the
		servlet container that is part of the JavaWebServer.
		Stand-alone is the default mode used by Tomcat. Most web
		servers, however, are not Java-based, which leads us to
		the next two container types.</dd>
        
	<dt><strong>In-process servlet containers</strong>
	<dd>The servlet container is a combination of a web server
		plugin and a Java container implementation. The web
		server plugin opens a JVM inside the web server's
		address space and lets the servlet container run in it.
		If a certain request should execute a servlet, the
		plugin takes control over the request and passes it
		(using <a
		href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/jni/index.html">JNI</a>)
		to the servlet container. An in-process container is
		suitable for multi-threaded single-process servers and
		provides good performance but is limited in
		scalability.</dd>
            
	<dt><strong>Out-of-process servlet containers</strong>
	<dd>The servlet container is a combination of a web server
		plugin and a Java container implementation that runs in
		a JVM outside the web server. The web server plugin and
		the Java container JVM communicate using some IPC
		mechanism (usually TCP/IP sockets). If a certain request
		should execute a servlet the plugin takes control over
		the request and passes it (using IPC) to the servlet
		container. The response time of an out-of-process engine
		is not as good as in the in-process one but the
		out-of-process engine performs better in many measurable
		ways (scalability, stability, etc.).</dd>   
</dl>

    <p>Tomcat can be used as either a stand-alone container
      (mainly for development and debugging) or as an add-on to an
      existing web server (currently Apache, IIS and Netscape servers are 
      supported). This means that whenever you are deploying Tomcat you will 
      have to decide how to use it and, if you select options 2 or 3, you
      will also need to install a web server adapter.</p>

      <p>If this is your first time configuring Tomcat and you plan on integrating
      it with a web server, you're better off initially running it
      stand-alone. You'll be better able to isolate errors during
      integration with your web server when you do so in the future - &quot;Is
      Tomcat or my web server at fault for the error I'm seeing?&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="web_xml">web.xml - Default deployment descriptor</a></h4>

    <blockquote>
    <p>
      A detailed description of web.xml and the web application structure
      (including directory structure and configuration) is available in
      chapters 9, 10 and 13 of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html">Servlet API Spec</a>
      and we are not going to write about it. <a href="../appdev/index.html">Developing Applications with Tomcat</a>
      covers web application and deployment with Tomcat. <strong>It is required reading if you're not going to
      take the time to read through the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html">Servlet API Spec</a>!</strong> </p>
    <p>
      There is a small Tomcat "feature" that is related
      to web.xml. Tomcat lets the user define default web.xml values for all
      contexts by putting a default web.xml file in the conf subdirectory of
      TOMCAT_HOME. When
      constructing a new Context, Tomcat uses the default web.xml file as the
      base configuration, and then applies the application specific web.xml (the
      application's WEB-INF/web.xml file) settings.</p>

<p>This means that in Tomcat, you can get away with an empty
web.xml file, containing only the element

<tt><big>&lt;web-app/&gt;</big></tt>, or (more realistically)
containing only the elements (e.g. mappings and mime-types) you need.  However, this will limit your
webapp's portability, so it is recommended to use a full web.xml
file.  You may instead want to copy TOMCAT_HOME/conf/web.xml and modify it.</p>

    <p>We cover certain aspects of web.xml in subsequent sections, where it
      pertains to application deployment and interaction with Tomcat.</p>

<h4>What is a Web Application?</h4>

<p>[??? - move this section up above the Configuring Tomcat section? It's
not clear whether we should teach about webapps before or after we
introduce server.xml et al.]</p>

<p>A Web Application (or "webapp") is a concept that was introduced in
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.2/">Servlet
Specification</a> version 2.2. [2.1?] You should definitely read the
spec for the full story. From the spec (chapter 9):</p>

<!--[[blockquote]] not sure what the range of this quite is supposed to be-->
<p>A web application is a collection of servlets, html pages, classes, and other resources that can be
bundled and run on multiple containers from multiple vendors. A web application is rooted at a
specific path within a web server. For example, a catalog application could be located at http://
www.mycorp.com/catalog. All requests that start with this prefix will be routed to the
ServletContext which represents the catalog application.</p>

<p>A servlet container can also establish rules for automatic generation of web applications. For
example a ~user/ mapping could be used to map to a web application based at /home/user/
public_html/.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>A web application exists as a structured hierarchy of directories. The
root of this hierarchy serves as a document root for serving files
that are part of this context. For example, for a web application
located at /catalog in a web server, the index.html file located at
the base of the web application hierarchy can be served to satisfy a
request to /catalog/index.html.</p>

<p>A special directory exists within the application hierarchy named "WEB-INF". This directory
contains all things related to the application that aren't in the document root of the application. It is
important to note that the WEB-INF node is not part of the public document tree of the application.
No file contained in the WEB-INF directory may be served directly to a client.</p>

<p>The contents of the WEB-INF directory are:</p>

<ul>
<li> /WEB-INF/web.xml deployment descriptor </li>
<li> /WEB-INF/classes/* directory for servlet and utility classes. The classes in this directory
are used by the application class loader to load classes from. </li>
<li> /WEB-INF/lib/*.jar area for Java ARchive files which contain servlets, beans, and other
utility classes useful to the web application. All such archive files are used by the web
application class loader to load classes from. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Web Application Directory Structure</h3>

<p>Illustrated here is a listing of all the files in a sample web application:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>/index.html
/howto.jsp
/feedback.jsp
/images/banner.gif
/images/jumping.gif
/WEB-INF/web.xml
/WEB-INF/lib/jspbean.jar
/WEB-INF/classes/com/mycorp/servlets/MyServlet.class
/WEB-INF/classes/com/mycorp/util/MyUtils.class
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can deploy a WAR file that is present on the local filesystem by
adding a &lt;Context&gt; tag to TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml. For
example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;Context path="/mywebapp" 
  docBase="/home/alex/webapps/mywebapp" 
  reloadable="true" &gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h4><a name="what_is_war">What is a WAR file?</a></h4>

<p><em>"WAR. Huh! What is it good for?" - Edwin Starr</em></p>

<p>A WAR (or "web archive") file is simply a packaged webapp directory.
It is created using the standard Java <tt><big>jar</big></tt> tool.
For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>cd /home/alex/webapps/mywebapp 
jar cf mywebapp.war *</pre></blockquote>

<h4><a name="deploying_war">Deploying WAR files in Tomcat</a></h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently (as of version 3.2) the procedure for deploying a new WAR file is:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Stop Tomcat.</strong></li>
	<li><p><strong>Delete existing deployment.</strong> If you have
		previously deployed &quot;foo.war&quot; in
		TOMCAT_HOME/webapps, then it has been unpacked into
		webapps/foo/...  You must delete this directory and all
		its contents. On Unix, this can be done with:</p>

		<pre>rm -r $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/foo</pre>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Copy WAR file to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Start Tomcat.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This process may become easier in the future. A &quot;deploy tool&quot; is on the Tomcat &quot;to-do&quot; list.</p>

<p>Note that if you deploy a WAR file in this manner, you do not need to
make any changes to <tt><big>server.xml</big></tt> -- it will 
automatically be recognized and activated when the server starts.
However, if you wish to specify non-default options for this webapp,
you may do so by adding an element like <tt><big>&lt;Context
docBase=&quot;webapps/foo&quot; ...</big></tt> to server.xml.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://www.jguru.com/jguru/faq/view.jsp?EID=123229">How
do I deploy a WAR file in Tomcat?</a> in the jGuru FAQ.</p>

<h3><a name="tutorials">Tomcat Tutorials</a></h3>

<p>These tutorials will be run with the assumption that Tomcat
	is operating as a stand-alone container. Like we said
	before, it can be helpful to understand Tomcat's
	functionality, irrespective of the particular web server
	you're using. Trying to get more than one thing working
	at once usually leads to more problems than its worth.
	Integration will be covered later in subsequent
	sections.</p>

[Note: add some tutorials here :-) ]


<h2>Real World Configuration Tips</h2>

<p>By default the Tomcat distribution comes with a naive
	configuration whose main goal is to promote first time
	user experience and an "out of the box" operation...
	This configuration however is not the best way to deploy
	Tomcat on real sites. For example, real sites may
	require some performance tuning and site-specific
	settings (additional path elements for example). This
	section will try to get you started by directing you to
	the first steps that should be taken before publishing a
	Tomcat based site.</p>

<h3>Modify and Customize the Batch Files</h3>
<p>As stated in the previous sections, the startup scripts are
	here for your convenience.  Yet, sometimes the scripts
	that are needed for deployment should be modified:</p>

<ul>
            <li> To set resource limits such as maximum number of
                 descriptors. </li>
            <li> To add new CLASSPATH entries (for example, JDBC drivers). </li>
            <li> To add new PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH entries (for example, JDBC
                 drivers DLLs). </li>
            <li> To modify the JVM command line settings. </li>
            <li> Make sure that you are using a specific JVM (out of the two
                 or three JVMs installed on your machine). </li>
            <li> To switch user from root to some other user using the "su"
                 UNIX command. </li>
            <li> Your pet reason. </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these changes can be done without explicit changes to
	the basic scripts; for example, the tomcat script can
	use an environment variable named <tt>TOMCAT_OPTS</tt>
	to set extra command line parameters to the JVM (such as
	memory setting etc.). On <em>UNIX</em> you can also
	create a file named <tt>".tomcatrc"</tt> in your home
	directory and Tomcat will take environment information
	such as PATH, JAVA_HOME, TOMCAT_HOME and CLASSPATH from
	this file. On NT however (and also on UNIX when the
	modifications are for something such as the JVM command
	line) you are forced to rewrite some of the startup
	script...</p>

<div><strong>Do not hesitate, just do it.</strong></div>

<h3>Modify the Default JVM Settings</h3>

<p>The default JVM settings in the tomcat script are very
	na&iuml;ve; everything is left for defaults. There are a
	few things that you should consider to improve your
	Tomcat performance:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Modify your JVM memory configuration. Normally the JVM
           allocates an initial size for the Java heap and that's it, if
           you need more then this amount of memory you will not get it.<br>
           Nevertheless, in loaded sites, giving more memory to the JVM
           improves Tomcat's performance. You should use command line
           parameters such as -Xms/-Xmx/-ms/-mx to set the minimum/maximum
           size of the Java heap (and check to see if the performance was
           improved). </li>

            <li> Modify your JVM threading configuration. The SUN JDK1.2.2 for
           Linux comes with support for both, green and native threads. In
           general native threads are known to provide improved performance
           for I/O bound applications, green threads on the other hand put
           less stress on the machine. You should experiment with these two
           threading models and see which model is better for your site (in
           general, native threads are better).</li>

            <li> Select the best JVM for the task. There are several JVM vendors,
           for example on Linux there are today (21/03/2000) two product level
           JVMs: the SUN JDK1.2.2 and the IBM JDK1.1.8. If your application
           does not require a specific JDK functionality, you should
           benchmark the two JVMs and select the better one. In my (Gal
           Shachor) internal tests I found the IBM JVM significantly faster
           than the one created by SUN, you should check that for yourself
           and make a calculated decision.
           </li>
        </ol>


<h3>Modify your Connectors</h3>

    <p>
        The Connectors, as configured in Tomcat's default server.xml
        contains two Connectors configured as in the next server.xml
        fragment:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" valign="middle">
	<caption><em>The two default Connectors in server.xml</em></caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<pre>
        &lt;!-- (1) HTTP Connector for stand-alone operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.SimpleTcpConnector&quot;&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;handler&quot;
                value=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.http.HttpConnectionHandler&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;port&quot;
                value=&quot;8080&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;

        &lt;!-- (2) AJPV12 Connector for out-of-process operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.SimpleTcpConnector&quot;&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;handler&quot;
                value=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp12ConnectionHandler&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;port&quot;
                value=&quot;8007&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
</table>

<ol>
            <li> Is a Connector that listens on port 8080 for incoming HTTP
                 requests. This connector is needed for stand-alone
                 operation.
            <li> Is a Connector that listens on port 8007 for incoming AJPV12
                 requests. This connector is needed for web-server
                 integration (out-of-process servlet integration).
        </ol>

<p>It is clear that a sane Tomcat deployment will use either an
        out-of-process servlet integration or a stand-alone operation,
        removing the unnecessary Connector is important.</p>


<h3>Use a Thread Pool in your Connectors</h3>

    <p>
        Tomcat is a multi-threaded servlet container this means that each
        request needs to be executed by some thread. By default when a
        request arrives Tomcat creates a new thread, starts it and has it
        serve the request. This behavior is problematic for loaded sites
        because:</p>

<ul>
            <li>Starting and stopping a thread  for every request puts a
                needless burden on the operating system and the JVM.</li>
            <li>It is hard to limit the resource consumption. If 300
                requests arrive concurrently Tomcat will open 300
                threads to serve them and allocate all the resources needed
                to serve all the 300 requests at the same time.  This causes
                Tomcat to allocate much more resources (CPU, Memory,
                Descriptors...) than it should and it can lead to low
                performance and even crashes if resources are exhausted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution for these problems is to use a <strong>thread pool</strong>.
        Servlet containers that are using a thread pool relieve themselves
        from directly managing their threads. Instead of allocating new
        threads; whenever they need a thread they ask for it from the pool,
        and when they are done, the thread is returned to the pool. The
        thread pool can now be used to implement sophisticated thread
        management techniques, such as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Keeping threads "open" and reusing them over and over
                 again. This saves the trouble associated with creating and 
				 destroying threads continuously.
	<ul>
		<li>Usually the administrator can instruct the pool not to keep too many idle threads, freeing them if needed.</li>
	</ul>
            </li>

	<li>Setting an upper bound on the number of threads used
                 concurrently. This prevents the resources allocation
                 problem associated with unlimited thread allocation.
	<ul>
		<li>If the container maxed out to the threads upper limit, and a new
                 request arrives, the new request will have to wait for
                 some other (previous) request to finish and free the thread
                 used to service it.</li>
	</ul>
            </li>
</ol>

<p>You can refine the techniques described above in various ways, but
        these are only refinements. The main contribution of thread pools is
        thread-reuse and having a concurrency upper bound that limits
        resource usage.</p>

    <p>
        Using a thread pool in Tomcat is a simple move; all you need to do
        is to use a <tt>PoolTcpConnector</tt> in your &lt;Connector&gt;
        configuration. For example the following server.xml fragment defines
        ajpv12, pooled Connector:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" valign="middle">
	<caption><em>Pooled ajpv12 Connector</em></caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">

<pre>&lt;!-- A pooled AJPV12 Connector for out-of-process operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector&quot;&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;handler&quot;
                value=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp12ConnectionHandler&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;port&quot;
                value=&quot;8007&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
</table>

<p>This fragment is very simple and the (default) pool behaviour
        instructed by it is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Upper bound for concurrency of 50 threads. </li>
            <li> When the pool has more then 25 threads standing idle it
                 will start to kill them. </li>
            <li> The pool will start 10 threads on creation, and it will try
                 to keep 10 vacant threads (as long as the upper bound is
                 kept). </li>
        </ul>
        The default configuration is suitable for medium load sites with an
        average of 10-40 concurrent requests. If your site differs you
        should modify this configuration (for example reduce the upper
        limit). Configuring the pool can be done through the &lt;Connector&gt;
        element in server.xml as demonstrated in the next fragment:
        <p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" valign="middle">
	<caption><em>Configuring the Thread Pool</em></caption>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
<pre>
        &lt;!-- A pooled AJPV12 Connector for out-of-process operation --&gt;
        &lt;Connector className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector&quot;&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;handler&quot;
                value=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp12ConnectionHandler&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;port&quot;
                value=&quot;8007&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;max_threads&quot;
                value=&quot;30&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;max_spare_threads&quot;
                value=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;Parameter
                name=&quot;min_spare_threads&quot;
                value=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
</table>

<p>As can be seen the pool has 3 configuration parameters:</p>

<ul>
            <li> max_threads - defines the upper bound to the for the 
			     concurrency, the pool will not create more then this number 
				 of threads. </li>
            <li> max_spare_threads - defines the maximum number of threads
                 that the pool will keep idle. If the number of idle threads
                 passes the value of max_spare_threads the pool will kill
                 these threads. </li>
            <li> min_spare_threads - the pool will try to make sure that at
                 any time there is at least this number of idle threads
                 waiting for new requests to arrive. min_spare_threads must
                 be bigger then 0.</li>
        </ul>

        You should use the above parameters to adjust the pool behavior to
        your needs.


<h3>Disable Servlet Auto-Reloading</h3>

    <p>
        Servlet auto-reloading is really useful for development time.
        However it is very expensive (in performance degradation terms) and
        may put your application in strange conflicts when classes that were
        loaded by a certain classloader cannot co-operate with classes
        loaded by the current classloader.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, unless you have a real need for class reloading during your
        deployment you should turn off the reloadable flag in your contexts.
    </p>

<h3>Start Tomcat from /etc/inittab</h3>

    <p>
        Unfortunately the adapters developed for Apache (or for any of the
        other servers) cannot start Tomcat yet. On UNIX however, you can
        use the init table to start Tomcat automatically upon machine
        startup. FIXME:
    </p>

<h1>Tomcat IIS HowTo</h1>

<p>By Gal Shachor <tt>&lt;shachor@il.ibm.com&gt;</tt></p>

<p>This document explains how to set up IIS to cooperate with Tomcat.
Normally IIS can not execute Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs),
configuring IIS to use the Tomcat redirector plugin will let IIS send servlet
and JSP requests to Tomcat (and this way, serve them to clients). </p>

<h2>Document Conventions and Assumptions</h2>

<p>&lt;tomcat_home&gt; is the root directory of tomcat. Your Tomcat
installation should have the following subdirectories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\conf - Where you can place various configuration files</li>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\webapps - Containing example applications </li>
  <li>&lt;tomcat_home&gt;\bin - Where you may place web server plugins </li>
</ol>

<p>In all the examples in this document &lt;tomcat_home&gt; will be c:\jakarta-tomcat.</p>

<p>A <tt>worker</tt> is defined to be a tomcat process that accepts work from the IIS
server.</p>

<h2>Supported Configuration</h2>

<p>The IIS-Tomcat redirector was developed and tested on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Win2k SP2, WinNT4.0-i386 SP4/SP5/SP6a, and Win98 </li>
  <li>IIS 5.0, PWS 5.0, IIS4.0 and PWS4.0 </li>
  <li>Tomcat3.0 - Tomcat3.3</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> Due to some feature additions, the IIS-Tomcat redirector from
earlier Tomcat's can't be used with Tomcat 3.3.  Only use the IIS-Tomcat
redirector from Tomcat 3.3, or newer versions from the jakarta-tomcat-connectors
Jakarta project.</p>

<p>The redirector uses <b>ajp13</b> or <b>ajp12</b> to send requests to the Tomcat 
  containers. There is also an option to use Tomcat in process, more about the 
  in-process mode can be found in the <a href="in-process-howto.html">in process 
  howto.</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As of Tomcat 3.2, a pre-built version of the Tomcat redirector plugin,
<tt>isapi_redirect.dll</tt>, is available under the win32/i386 directory where you
downloaded the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html">
Tomcat binary distribution.</a> For those using Netscape as your browser, try
downloading a zip version of the file, if available. There can be problems using
Netscape to download DLL files.</p>

<p>You can also build a copy locally from the source in Tomcat's source
distribution.</p>

<p>The Tomcat redirector requires three entities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>isapi_redirect.dll - The Tomcat redirector plugin, either obtain a pre-built
  DLL or build it yourself (see the build section).</li>
  <li>workers.properties - A file that describes the host(s) and port(s) used
  by the workers (Tomcat processes). A sample <tt>workers.properties</tt> can
  be found under the <tt>conf/jk</tt> directory. </li>
  <li>uriworkermap.properties - A file that maps URL-Path patterns to
  workers. A sample <tt>uriworkermap.properties</tt> can be found under the
  <tt>conf/jk</tt> directory as well. Also, this is one of the files generated
  by the <a href="serverxml.html#IISConfig">IISConfig</a> module included by
  default in the <code>server.xml</code> file. The
  <code>uriworkermap.properties</code> file it generates is written to the
  <code>conf/auto</code> directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>The installation includes the following parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start Tomcat 3.3 with the &quot;jkconf&quot; specified so configuration
      files are written.</li>
  <li>Configure the Tomcat redirector plugin with the configuration files and
      check that you can serve servlets and JSPs with IIS.</li>
  <li>Repeat the appropriate portions of the previous steps when changes to
      configuration or contexts occur.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Creating the Configuration Files</h3>

<p>The default installation of Tomcat 3.3 includes the
<a href="serverxml.html#IISConfig">IISConfig</a> module in the
<code>server.xml</code> file.  This module is responsible for writting the
configuration files used for Tomcat redirector plugin installation and operation.</p>

<p>In Tomcat 3.3, configuration files are written on demand. You must start
Tomcat 3.3 with the &quot;jkconf&quot; option specified. Tomcat 3.3 will
initialize, write the configuration files, and then exit.  This may be done,
while an instance of Tomcat 3.3 is running.  This differs from prior versions
of Tomcat where the configuration files are written each time Tomcat is
started.</p>

<p>The IISConfig module in Tomcat 3.3 writes two configuration files.  The first
is the registry configuration file, which by default will be
<code>conf/auto/iis_redirect.reg</code>.  The second is the worker map
configuration file, which by default will be
<code>conf/auto/uriworkermap.properties</code>.</p>

<p>The IISConfig module in Tomcat 3.3.1 writes a third configuration file.  This
file contains the same settings as the registry configuration file and
provides an alternate means of configuring the Tomcat redirector plugin
without relying on the registry.  It defaults to writing
<code>conf/auto/isapi_redirect.properties</code>.</p>

<p>To use the &quot;properties&quot; file instead of registry settings,
the &quot;properties&quot; file must have the same name as the redirector
plugin DLL, except with a &quot;.properties&quot; extension.  It must also be
located in the same directory as the DLL. If both the &quot;properties&quot;
file and registry settings exist, the &quot;properties&quot; file will be
used.</p>

<h3>Configuring the ISAPI Tomcat Redirector</h3>

<p>The following steps show how to configure the Tomcat redirector plugin.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build or download the Tomcat redirector plugin DLL,
    <code>isapi_redirect.dll</code>, and place it in a suitable location.
    A typical location is <code>TOMCAT_HOME\bin\native</code>.  If you are
    installing on WinNT or Win2k, make sure IIS runs with a user that can
    access this directory.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li>Use either of the following two methods to provide configuration settings
    to the redirector plugin DLL.<br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Copy the <code>IISConfig</code> generated &quot;proprties&quot; file,
        <code>isapi_redirect.properties</code>, or a manually created one,
        to the directory where the redirector plugin DLL is found. Rename this
        file to have the same base name as the redirector plugin DLL should they
        happen to be different.</li>
      <li>Enter the registry settings from the registry configuration file into
        the registry.  This can be done from Windows Explorer by double-clicking
        the file or by right-clicking the file and selecting <code>Open</code>
        or <code>Merge</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Note:</b> If both are done, the &quot;properties&quot; file takes
      priority.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li>Using the IIS management console, add a new virtual directory to your
    IIS/PWS web site. The name of the virtual directory must be <b>jakarta</b>.
    Its	physical path should be the directory where you placed the redirector
    plugin DLL, <code>isapi_redirect.dll</code>
    (for example c:\jakarta-tomcat\bin\native). While creating this new
	virtual directory, assign it with execute access.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li>Add the redirector plugin DLL, <code>isapi_redirect.dll</code>, as a
    filter to your IIS/PWS web site. The name of the filter should reflect its task
    (for example, &quot;Jakarta Redirector&quot;). Its executable must be the
	redirector plugin DLL, <code>isapi_redirect.dll</code>.<br>
    <br>
    On WinNT and Win2k, you can use the IIS Management console to add the filter.<br>
    <br>
    For PWS on Win98, you'll need to use regedit and add/edit the
    &quot;Filter DLLs&quot; key under
    <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters.</code>
    This key contains a comma separated list of dlls ( full paths ). You need to
    add the full path to redirector plugin DLL, isapi_redirect.dll, to this key.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li>Restart IIS/PWS (stop + start the IIS service).  If you are using WinNT
    or Win2k, you can make sure that the jakarta filter is successfully loaded
    by checking for a green up-pointing arrow.<br>
    <br>
    On Win98, to properly stop and restart PWS, you should open an MS-DOS window,
    navigate to the <code>WINDOWS\SYSTEM\inetsrv</code> directory and execute
    <code>PWS /stop</code>. Then execute <code>PWS</code> to start it again.
 </li>
</ol>

<p>That's all, you should now start Tomcat and ask IIS to serve you the /examples context.
Try <a href="http://localhost/examples/jsp/index.html">http://localhost/examples/jsp/index.html</a>
for example and execute some of the JSP examples.  If this does not work successfully,
refer to the <a href="#troubleshoot">Troubleshooting</a> section below for help
on correcting the problem.</p>

<h3>Adding additional Contexts</h3>

<p>The examples context is useful for verifying your installation, but you will also need
to add your own contexts. Adding a new context requires two operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adding the context to Tomcat (This is covered in the
    <a href="tomcat-ug.html#context_addcust">Tomcat User's Guide</a>).</li>
  <li>Adding the context to the Tomcat redirector plugin.</li>
</ol>

<p>Adding a context to the Tomcat redirector plugin is simple, all you need to do is to
start Tomcat 3.3 with &quot;jkconf&quot; option specified again. After the
worker map file is rewritten, restart IIS/PWS.</p>

<p>If you are using a manually modified URI to worker map file, edit the file
to add a line that looks like: </p>

<p><tt>/context/*=worker_name</tt></p>

<p>Workers and their name are defined in workers.properties, by default workers.properties 
  comes with 2 pre-configured workers named &quot;<b>ajp13</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>ajp12</b>&quot; 
  so you can use it. As an example, if you want to add a context named &quot;shop&quot;, 
  the line that you should add to <tt>uriworkermap.properties</tt> will be:</p>

<p><tt>/shop/*=ajp13</tt></p>

<p>After saving <tt>uriworkermap.properties</tt> restart IIS/PWS and it will
serve the new context.</p>

<h3>The Tomcat Redirector Plugin Configuration Settings</h3>

<p>The following is an example isapi_redirect.properties file which contains
the default settings for Tomcat 3.3.</p>

<pre>
extension_uri=/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll
log_file=E:\Jakarta\Tc33x\jakarta-tomcat\dist\tomcat\logs\iis_redirect.log
log_level=emerg
worker_file=E:\Jakarta\Tc33x\jakarta-tomcat\dist\tomcat\conf\jk\workers.properties
worker_mount_file=E:\Jakarta\Tc33x\jakarta-tomcat\dist\tomcat\conf\auto\uriworkermap.properties
</pre>

<p>The Tomcat redirector plugin for Tomcat 3.3.1 supporta an additional setting
with the following default.</p>

<pre>
uri_select=parsed
</pre>

<p>The following table describes the use of each of these settings:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th align="left">Setting</th><th align="left">Description</th>
    <th align="left">Default</th></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">extension_uri</td>
    <td>The URI used by the redirector plugin's filter to redirect the request
    to the extension. This setting consists of the name of the
    virtual directory followed by the name of the DLL.</td>
    <td>/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">log_file</td>
    <td>The path of the log file for the redirector plugin DLL</td>
    <td><i>must be specified</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>log_level</td>
    <td>The quantity of log output desired. Valid values are
    debug, info, error, and emerg.</td><td>emerg</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">worker_file</td>
    <td>The path to the workers definition file, typically named
    <code>worker.properties</code></td>
    <td><i>must be specified</i></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">worker_mount_file</td>
   <td>The path to the URI to worker map file, typically named
    <code>uriworkermap.properties</code>.</td>
    <td><i>must be specified</i></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">uri_select<br>
    <b>[Tomcat 3.3.1]</b></td>
    <td>This settings controls which of several forms of
    the URI is passed to Tomcat.  The following are the valid values:<br>
    <br>
    <table>
    <tr><th align="left">Value</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">parsed</td><td>Internally, the redirector plugin
        normalizes and decodes the request URI before checking the request
        against the URI to worker mappings. This value passes this
        normalized/decoded version of the URI to Tomcat.</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">unparsed</td>
        <td>Passes the original (i.e. unnormalized and undecoded) request URI
        to Tomcat.</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">escaped</td>
        <td>Passes a re-encoded version normalized/decoded request URI to
        Tomcat.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    Setting this value properly is important so that request data, such as
    HttpServletRequest.getRequestURI(), are returned with the proper encoding.
    Tomcat 3.3 and later requires the <code>parsed</code> setting. Tomcat 3.2.x
    can use either <code>unparsed</code> or <code>escaped</code>.  For
    Tomcat 3.2.1 and earlier, <code>escaped</code> should be used since it
    does not do its own normalization.
    </td><td valign="top">parsed</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Building the Tomcat redirector</h2>

<p>The Tomcat redirector was developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, so having this
environment is a prerequisite if you want to perform a custom build.</p>

<p>The steps that you need to take are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change directory to the isapi redirector plugins source directory.</li>
  <li>Execute the following command:<br>
    <tt>MSDEV isapi.dsp /MAKE ALL</tt><br>
    If msdev is not in your path, enter the full path to msdev.exe</li>
</ol>

<p>This will build both release and debug versions of the redirector plugin. </p>

<p>An alternative will be to open the isapi workspace file (isapi.dsw) in msdev and build
it using the build menu.</p>

<h2>How does it work? </h2>

<ol>
  <li>The IIS-Tomcat redirector is an IIS plugin (filter + extension), IIS loads the redirector
    plugin and calls its filter function for each in-coming request. </li>
  <li>The filter then tests the request URL against a list of URI-paths held inside
    <tt>uriworkermap.properties</tt>, If the current request matches one of the entries in the list of
    URI-paths, the filter transfers the request to the extension.</li>
  <li>The extension collects the request parameters and forwards them to the appropriate
    worker using the ajp1X protocol.</li>
  <li>The extension collects the response from the worker and returns it to the browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advanced Context Configuration</h2>

<p>Unlike prior versions, Tomcat 3.3 writes config files which default to
sending all requests, including those for static pages, to Tomcat for processing.
This gives the best chance for the web application configuration specified in the
<code>web.xml</code> file to work successfully.</p>

<p>Also, unlike prior versions, the default worker map file does not try
to add servlet or JSP operation to the IIS/PWS main virtual directory.  To
see how to control the manner in which Tomcat writes the worker map file see
the reference information on the <a href="serverxml.html#IISConfig">IISConfig</a>
module.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to have IIS serve the static pages (html, gif, jpeg etc.) even
if these files are part of a context served by Tomcat. For example, consider the html and
gif files in the examples context, there is no need to serve them from the Tomcat process,
IIS will suffice.</p>

<p>Making IIS serve static files that are part of the Tomcat contexts requires the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Configuring IIS to know about the Tomcat contexts</li>
  <li>Configuring the redirector to leave the static files for IIS</li>
</ol>

<p>Adding a Tomcat context to IIS requires the addition of a new IIS virtual directory
that covers the Tomcat context. For example adding a /example IIS virtual directory that
covers the c:\jakarta-tomcat\webapps\examples directory. </p>

<p>Configuring the redirector is somewhat harder, you will need to specify the exact
URL-Path pattern(s) that you want Tomcat to handle (usually only JSP files and servlets).
This requires a change to the <tt>uriworkermap.properties</tt>. For the examples context it
requires to replace the following line:</p>

<p><tt>/examples/*=ajp13</tt></p>

<p>with the following two lines:</p>

<p><tt>/examples/*.jsp=ajp13<br>
  /examples/servlet/*=ajp13</tt></p>
<p>As you can see the second configuration is more explicit, it actually instruct the
redirector to redirect only requests to resources under <tt>/examples/servlet/</tt> and
resources under <tt>/examples/ </tt>whose name ends with <tt>.jsp</tt>. This is
similar to what is automatically written to the <tt>uriworkermap.properties-auto</tt>
file for each context.</p>

<p>You can even be more explicit and provide lines such as:</p>

<p><tt>/example/servletname=ajp13</tt> </p>

<p>that instructs the redirector to redirect request whose URL-Path equals <tt>/example/servletname 
  </tt>to the worker named ajp13.</p>

<h3>Protecting the WEB-INF Directory</h3>

<p>Each servlet application (context) has a special directory named WEB-INF, this
directory contains sensitive configurations data and Java classes and must be kept hidden
from web users. Using the IIS management console it is possible to protect the WEB-INF
directory from user access, this however requires the administrator to remember that. To
avoid this need the redirector plugin automatically protects your WEB-INF directories by
rejecting any request that contains WEB-INF in its URL-Path.</p>

<h2>Advanced Worker Configuration</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to serve different contexts with different Tomcat processes (for
example to spread the load among different machines). To achieve such goal you will need
to define several workers and assign each context with its own worker.</p>

<p>Defining workers is done in <tt>workers.properties</tt>, this file includes
two types of entries:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An entry that lists all the workers defined. For example:<br>
    <tt>worker.list=ajp12, ajp13, ajp13second</tt></li>
  <li>Entries that define the host and port associated with these workers. For 
    example:<br>
    <tt>worker.ajp12.host=farhost<br>
    worker.ajp12.port=8007<br>
    worker.ajp13.host=localhost<br>
    worker.ajp13.port=8009<br>
    worker.ajp13second.host=otherhost<br>
    worker.ajp13second.port=8009</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>The above examples defined three workers, now we can use these workers to serve two
different contexts each with its own worker. For example look at the following
<tt>uriworkermap.properties</tt> fragment:</p>

<p><tt>/examples/*=ajp12 <br>
  /webapp1/*=ajp13 <br>
  /webapp2/*=ajp13second </tt></p>

<p>As you can see the examples context is served by ajp12 while the webapp1 context 
  is served by ajp13, and the webapp2 context is served by the ajp13second worker. 
</p>

<h2><a name="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p>It is easy to have the Tomcat redirector not work the first time you try to install
it.  If this happens to you, here are some steps to follow to try to correct the
problem. These steps aren't guaranteed to cover all possible problems, but they
should help find the typical mistakes.  If you make any corrections during these
steps, restart the IIS service as described above in the last step of the installation,
then retry the step.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> These steps assume your <tt>worker_mount_file</tt> setting points
to an unmodified copy of the <code>conf/auto/uriworkermap.properties</code> file.
Results may be misleading if <tt>worker_mount_file</tt> points to a modified
version of the file.  It is also assumed that the &quot;/examples&quot;
context works correctly if you access Tomcat directly.</p>

<h3>Win98</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure web site activity is being logged. For PWS make sure &quot;Save 
    Web Site Activity Log&quot; is checked in the Advanced Options of the Personal 
    Web Manager.</li>
  <li>Start the PWS service and Tomcat.</li>
  <li>Check for the presence of the Tomcat redirector log file you specified in 
    the <tt>log_file</tt> setting. If not found, check the following: 
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Check the &quot;Filter DLLs&quot; setting in the &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters&quot; 
        key and make sure the path is correct.</li>
      <li>Check the spelling of the &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software 
        Foundation\Jakarta Isapi Redirector\1.0&quot; key. Case isn't important, 
        but an incorrect letter will prevent the isapi_redirect.dll from finding 
        its registry settings.</li>
      <li>Check the <tt>log_file</tt> setting for typos, name and data. Also ensure 
        the directory in which the log file will appear already exists.</li>
    </ol>
    If the above are set correctly, the Tomcat redirector should be able to create 
    the log file.</li>
  <li>Invoke the URL &quot;http://localhost/examples/jsp/index.html&quot; in your 
    browser. Case is important. The characters following &quot;localhost&quot; 
    in the URL must be lower case. If the page fails to appear, stop the PWS service 
    (required to view the PWS log file). Then examine the last line in the PWS 
    log file in found in SYSTEM/LogFiles/W3SVC1. 
    <ol type="A">
      <li>If the last line contains: <tt>GET &quot;/examples/jsp/index.html HTTP/1.1&quot; 
        404</tt>, then the Tomcat redirector is not recognizing that it should 
        be handling requests for the &quot;/examples&quot; context. Check the 
        following: 
        <ol>
          <li>Check the <tt>extension_uri</tt> name for typos.</li>
          <li>Check the <tt>worker_file</tt> setting for typos, name and data.</li>
          <li>Check the <tt>worker_mount_file</tt> setting typos, name and data.</li>
        </ol>
        If these are set correctly, the Tomcat redirector should recognize that 
        it should handle requests for the &quot;/examples&quot; context.</li>
      <li>If the last line contains something like: <tt>GET &quot;/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll 
        HTTP1.1&quot;</tt>, then the Tomcat redirector is recognizing that it should 
        handle the request, but is not successful at getting Tomcat to service 
        the request. 
        <ol>
          <li>If the number following <tt>GET &quot;/...&quot;</tt> is 404, check 
            the following: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Make sure you entered the URL correctly.</li>
              <li>Make sure the virtual directory created was called &quot;jakarta&quot;. 
                It should display in Personal Web Manager as &quot;/jakarta&quot; 
                (without the quotes).</li>
              <li>Make sure the <tt>extension_uri</tt> data begins with &quot;/jakarta/&quot; 
                (without the quotes).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If the number following <tt>GET &quot;/...&quot;</tt> is 500, check 
            the following: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Make sure that &quot;isapi_redirect.dll&quot; follows &quot;/jakarta/&quot; 
                in the <tt>extension_uri</tt> setting.</li>
              <li>Check the workers.properties file and make sure the port setting 
                for <tt>workers used</tt> is the same as the port specified in 
                the server.xml for the ajp13 or ajp12 connectors, normally this 
                ports are 8007 for ajp12 and 8009 for ajp13.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If the number following <tt>GET &quot;/...&quot;</tt> is 200 or 
            403, make sure you have checked Execute Access for the jakarta virtual 
            directory in the Advanced Options of the Personal Web Manager.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    If the above settings are correct, the index.html page should appear in your 
    browser. You should also be able to click the <b>Execute</b> links to execute 
    the JSP examples.</li>
</ol>

<h3>WinNT/Win2k</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure web site activity is being logged.  For IIS/PWS make sure
    &quot;Save Web Site Activity Log&quot; is checked in the Advanced Options of
    the Personal Web Manager.</li>
  <li>Start the World Wide Web Publishing Service and Tomcat.</li>
  <li>Check for the presence of the Tomcat redirector log file you specified in the
    <tt>log_file</tt> setting. If not found, check the following:
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Check the &quot;executable&quot; you set for the filter in the IIS
        Management Console and make sure the path is correct.</li>
      <li>Check the spelling of the &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software
        Foundation\Jakarta Tomcat Redirector\1.0&quot; key. Case isn't important,
        but an incorrect letter will prevent the isapi_redirect.dll from finding
        its registry settings.</li>
      <li>Check the <tt>log_file</tt> setting for typos, name and data.  Also
        ensure the directory in which the log file will appear already exists.</li>
    </ol>
    If the above are set correctly, the Tomcat redirector should be able to create
    the log file.</li>
  <li>Check the jakarta filter you added and make sure its status shows a green
    upward-pointing arrow. If not, check the following:
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Check the <tt>worker_file</tt> setting for typos, name and data.</li>
      <li>Check the <tt>worker_mount_file</tt> setting typos, name and data.</li>
    </ol>    
    If the above are set correctly, the green upward-pointing arrow should appear,
    even if the other settings are wrong.</li>
  <li>Invoke the URL &quot;http://localhost/examples/jsp/index.html&quot; in your
    browser. Case is important.  The characters following
    &quot;localhost&quot; in the URL must be lower case. If the page fails to
    appear, examine the last line in the IIS server log file in found in
    SYSTEM32/LogFiles/W3SVC1.
    <ol type="A">
      <li>The last line should contain something like: <tt>GET &quot;/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll
        HTTP1.1&quot;</tt>, which indicates the Tomcat redirector is recognizing
        that it should handle the request.
        <ol>
          <li>If the number following <tt>GET &quot;/...&quot;</tt> is 404, check
            the following:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Make sure you entered the URL correctly.</li>
            </ol></li>
          <li>If the number following <tt>GET &quot;/...&quot;</tt> is 500, check
            the following:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Make sure the virtual directory created was called &quot;jakarta&quot;.</li>
              <li>Make sure that the <tt>extension_uri</tt> setting is correct.</li>
              <li>Check the workers.properties file and make sure the port setting 
                for <tt>workers used </tt> is the same as the port specified in 
                the server.xml for the ajp13 or ajp12 connectors, normally this 
                ports are 8007 for ajp12 and 8009 for ajp13.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
          <li>If the number following <tt>GET &quot;/...&quot;</tt> is 200 or 403,
            make sure you have checked Execute Access for the jakarta virtual
            directory in the Advanced Options of the Personal Web Manager. If
            you created the &quot;Filter DLLs&quot; key in the registry, delete
            it.  That registry key is only used on Win98.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    If the above settings are correct, the index.html page should appear in your
    browser.  You should also be able to click the <b>Execute</b> links to
    execute the JSP examples.</li>
</ol>

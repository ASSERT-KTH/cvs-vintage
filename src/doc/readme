=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

Tomcat is a servlet container and JavaServer Pages(tm) implementation.  It may
be used stand alone, or in conjunction with several popular web servers:
- Apache, version 1.3 or later
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 4.0 or later
- Microsoft Personal Web Server, version 4.0 or later
- Netscape Enterprise Server, version 3.0 or later

You should read the License Agreement (in the LICENSE file of the top level
directory), which applies to all software included in this release.


=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLING AND RUNNING TOMCAT

Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Environment conformant to JRE 1.1 or later,
including any Java2 platform system.  If you wish to develop applications,
you will need a Java compiler, such as the one included in a Java Development
Kit 1.1 or later environment, including JDKs conformant with Java2.

For detailed information about installing and running Tomcat, point your
browser at the file "tomcat_ug.html" found in the same directory as this
file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some major changes have occurred in Tomcat 3.3 which
make it quite different from Tomcat 3.2.x in a number of ways.  Many of
these differences are covered in the Tomcat User's Guide (tomcat-ug.html)
found in Tomcat's "docs" directory.  Some of the more important changes
include the following:

- Class Loading:

  Tomcat 3.3 shell and batch files ignore your CLASSPATH environment variable.

  Also, Tomcat 3.3 uses a much different hierarchy of class loaders from
  Tomcat 3.2.x. This allows Tomcat 3.3 to avoid imposing its XML parser
  on all the web applications. In fact, for web applications that don't
  contain an XML parser, Tomcat 3.3 can be configured to automatically
  provide one or not provide one.  The default is to automatically provide
  an XML parser.

  For information on configuring classes, refer to the "Configuring Classes"
  section of the Tomcat User's guide (tomcat-ug.html) in Tomcat's doc directory.

- Tomcat Configuration:

  Tomcat's configuration is still controlled by the server.xml file. But this
  file will look a little different and configuration is supported by a
  number of new features in Tomcat 3.3. Some of these new features are:

  1. A modules.xml file which simplifies the syntax found in server.xml.

  2. Context configurations can be specified in other files, instead of
     server.xml.

  3. Auto WAR file expansion and auto-deployment is now configurable and
     no longer hardwired to specific directories.

  4. The "conf" directory is better organized using subdirectorys. For
     example, all auto-generated files are written to the "conf\auto"
     directory.

  5. For mod_jk based connectors, their auto-generated files are not
     written during normal Tomcat startup.  Instead you should append
     "jkconf" to the startup command.  This will cause Tomcat to initialize,
     write the config files, and exit.  This may be done while Tomcat
     is already running.  For mod_jserv, you will need to add
     "<JservConfig />" to the server.xml file.  The
     "conf/auto/tomcat-apache.conf" file will be written each time Tomcat
     is started.

- Enhanced mod_jk Connector

  The mod_jk connector for Apache 1.3 now supports chunked input.

  Important Note: The chunked input enhancement required a protocol change
                  that makes Tomcat 3.3 incompatible with mod_jk base
                  connectors from Tomcat 3.2.3 and earlier.  Only use
                  connectors supplied with the Tomcat 3.3 release or the
                  jakarta-tomcat-connectors project with Tomcat 3.3.

- Tomcat Testing:

  The "test" web application along with the test-tomcat.xml and associated
  support files are not part of the binary Tomcat 3.3 distribution.  The
  "test" web application is supplied separately as "test.war".  This file
  may be downloaded from the "v3.3/apps" directory of the Tomcat 3.3
  release and placed in the "webapps" directory of your installation.  Running
  the test has been integrated into the Admin web application that is part of
  the Tomcat 3.3 distribution.  A preliminary step to running the test is to
  "trust" the Admin web application.  It is set to "untrusted" by default. This
  change can be accomplished by executing the command from the TOMCAT_HOME
  directory with JAVA_HOME set:

	./bin/tomcat.sh enableAdmin    <-- Unix
	bin\tomcat enableAdmin         <-- Windows

  Start or restart Tomcat 3.3 and invoke the following URL in your browser:

	http://localhost:8080/admin/test/test.jsp

  and then click "Submit Query".  The build targets for the Ant based test
  script are then listed and the tests executed.  After the tests are
  completed, the results will appear with "FAILED Tests" listed first,
  followed the "PASSED Tests".

  If you use Jikes as the Java compiler for JSP, you will need version
  1.14-1 or later to run all the tests without error.  Some tests will fail
  due to Java compilation errors if an earlier Jikes compiler is used.
  See <http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/> for
  the latest version.
	
  For security reasons, after you are done with the test, you should either
  restore the Admin web application to the default "untrusted" state, or change
  the password for the "admin" user. To restore the Admin web application to
  the default "untrusted" state, change trusted="true" to trusted="false" in
  the "apps-admin.xml" file found in Tomcat's "conf" directory. If you want to
  leave the Admin web application as "trusted, you should change the password
  for the "admin" user in the "admin-users.xml" file located in Tomcat's
  "conf/users" directory.

  You may also download the Watchdog servlet-tests.war and jsp-tests.war web
  applications to your "webapps" directory.  These tests may be run in the
  same fashion as the "test" web application using the following URLs:

	http://localhost:8080/admin/test/watchdog-servlet.jsp
	http://localhost:8080/admin/test/watchdog-jsp.jsp

3.  APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING TOMCAT

Preliminary information on using Tomcat for developing Servlet/JSP based
applications is provided in the included Application Developer's Guide.
Point your browser at file "doc/appdev/index.html" under the directory into
which you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
4.  TOMCAT: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE

- Version 3.0 (released 12/1999) was the initial release of Tomcat.  In 
addition to implementing the Java Servlet and Server Pages specification, 
this release featured a minimal Apache connector.

- Tomcat 3.1 (released 4/2000) improved the Apache connection and added 
connector support for Netscape and IIS web servers. It also added WAR file 
support, automatic servlet reloading, and a command line tool (jspc) to 
compile ahead of time the JSP pages that comprise your application.  Finally, 
version 3.1 also focused on reorganizing the code (modularization, cleanup, 
refactoring, removal of dead code, and separation of J2EE-specific code).

- Tomcat 3.2 is the first performance tune-up, and also added a few new 
features.

- Tomcat 3.3 is the completion of the modularization, cleanup, and
refactoring that started in Tomcat 3.1.  This work carries a number of
new features (see next section).

- Tomcat 4.x is separate development from Tomcat 3.x.  It is based on the
Catalina architecture, which is very different from the architecture of
Tomcat 3.x.  In addition, Tomcat 4.x is the reference implementation
for the Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.


=============================================================================
5.  NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Many new features have been added to Tomcat since the 3.2.x release.  Among the
most important are:

- The code has undergone a major refactoring effort resulting in improved
  performance, expanded configurability, and easier to maintain code.

- Auto-generated connector configuration files for mod_jk based connectors
  defaults to being generated on demand only.  This avoids the possibility
  of Tomcat rewritting the config file while a web server, such as Apache,
  tries to read it.

- Tag handler pooling has been added (but disabled by default).  If your JSPs
  use a lot of custom tags then you might want to enable tag pooling to
  increase performance.  To enable, add the TagPoolManagerInterceptor module
  inside an application's Context section such as:

    <Context path=...>
        <!-- other modules etc... -->
        <TagPoolManagerInterceptor/>
    </Context>

  See conf/server.xml for more information.

- The Tomcat documentation directory (i.e. TOMCAT_HOME/doc) is now included
  in the ROOT webapp and is available from a link in the root's index.html.

- A "modules" directory has been added where add-on modules may be placed.
  An add-on module is a special War file that "deploys" a module that
  participates in Tomcat's behavior, like the modules found in the server.xml
  file.

  Note: If an add-on module affects the behavior of Tomcat with respect to
        the Servlet2.2/JSP1.1 specifications, it invalidates Tomcat 3.3's
        status as a reference implementation.

- Many other improvements, too numerous to list.


In addition to new features, numerous changes have occured from the
Tomcat 3.2.x releases.  Among the more important behavior or usage
differences are:

- Your CLASSPATH environment variable is ignored by the Tomcat shell scripts
  and batch files found in TOMCAT_HOME/bin.  The classloader scheme in
  Tomcat 3.3 is more flexible and you now have choices concerning how
  classes are added.  See the Configuring Classes section of the
  Tomcat User's Guide (tomcat-ug.html) for details.

- Context declarations are normally not put in the server.xml file in
  Tomcat 3.3.  Instead, these declarations are placed XML files separate
  from server.xml.  See apps-admin.xml and apps-examples.xml files for a
  couple of examples of the new approach.  For backwards compatibility,
  you may still place context declarations in the server.xml file.

- The default content of the auto-generated configuration files for external
  web servers has changed. They now generate a configuration that forwards
  all requests for Tomcat contexts to Tomcat, including requests for static
  files.  This a allows the configuration specified in the context's web.xml
  file to work correctly.  Also, the default configuration generated does not
  add servlet or JSP functionality to the web server's "root" web site.

- When Tomcat is used with an external web server, such as Apache, the
  default behavior with respect to authentication has changed.  Previously,
  authentication was always done by the web server, with the web server
  providing the authenticated user.  This is now configurable, with the
  default set to Tomcat doing its own authentication.  Add
  tomcatAuthentication="false" to the Ajp13Interceptor to use the web
  server's authentication.

- Tomcat 3.3 now validates web.xml files during start up.  You may see errors
  previously unreported by Tomcat 3.2.x.

- The tomcat-users.xml file has moved from the "conf" to the "conf/users"
  directory.  Also, it is no longer used by the default configuration of
  Tomcat 3.3.  It continues to be the default file used by the SimpleRealm
  module.  Instead, of tomcat-users.xml, the SimpleRealm module in the default
  server.xml reads global-users.xml since those users apply to all contexts.
  The apps-examples.xml context configuration includes an additional
  SimpleRealm for the "/examples" context that reads the example-users.xml
  file.  Similarly, the "/admin" context includes a SimpleRealm that reads
  the admin-users.xml file.

- The Tomcat Users Guide (i.e. tomcat-ug.html) is now in the TOMCAT_HOME/doc
  directory instead of the TOMCAT_HOME/doc/uguide directory as it Tomcat 3.2.x.

- A change in the Ajp13 protocol for chunked input makes mod_jk based connectors
  Tomcat 3.2.3 and earlier to be incompatible with Tomcat 3.3.  Only use
  connectors from the Tomcat 3.3 release or the jakarta-tomcat-connectors project
  with Tomcat 3.3.


=============================================================================
6.  KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

6.1 Using An Absolute Path as Document Root Under Windows

In the TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml file, you can declare a relative or absolute
directory pathname for the docRoot attribute.  If you wish to use an absolute
pathname on a Windows system, you MUST include the drive letter in order to
conform to Java's definition of an absolute path on this platform:

    GOOD:  c:\mydirectory\mydocroot
    GOOD:  c:/mydirectory/mydocroot
    BAD:   \mydirectory\mydocroot
    BAD:   /mydirectory/mydocroot

Under Unix, absolute pathnames must begin with a slash ('/') character.

6.2 Container Managed Security

Tomcat 3.2 and later have an implementation of container managed security, as
described in the Servlet API Specification, version 2.2, section 11.
Please note the following information about this implementation:

- BASIC and FORM based authentication should work correctly.  Please
  report any bugs you encounter here at <http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla>.
  The example application has a protected area defined at the following URL:

	http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/security/protected

  which can be accessed by any user defined in the configuration file
  $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml that has been granted the
  appropriate roles.  Form-based authentication is used by default,
  but a commented out setting for Basic authentication is provided if
  you wish to give it a try.

  WARNING:  Basic authentication is not suitable for general security
  use across the Internet, or across other insecure networks, because
  usernames and passwords are sent encoded, but not encrypted, with
  every single request.

- DIGEST authentication and HTTPS client authentication (i.e. SSL)
  are not supported in this release.

6.3 Using RequestDispatcher.include() on a Welcome File

Using the following technique results in a response with incorrect content:

- You have a subdirectory under your document root
  (for example "subdir/").

- This subdirectory contains a welcome file that you
  have configured to be displayed when that subdirectory
  is requested on a URL (for example "index.html").

- You request a RequestDispatcher for path "/subdir"
  or path "/subdir/" and then call include() on it.

The same problem can occur when you do a <jsp:include/> to a page "/subdir"
or "/subdir/" as well.

A workaround is to ask for a RequestDispatcher on the complete context-
relative path of the file you wish to have displayed, such as
"/subdir/index.html".

6.4 Automatic Servlet Reloading

Tomcat 3.2 and later include a feature whereby you can ask it to automatically
reload servlet classes (loaded from either the WEB-INF/classes directory
or a JAR file in the WEB-INF/lib directory) that have been changed.  This
feature is experimental, and may not be completely functional.  In particular,
changes to classes other than the servlet you are requesting do not trigger
class reloads -- you will need to restart Tomcat to reflect changes in those
classes.

Reloading is enabled by including a reloadable="true" attribute on the
<Context> element in the "conf/server.xml" file.  Note that automatic
reload support is not recommended for production applications because of
its experimental nature, and the extra overhead required to perform the
necessary checks on every request.

6.5 Avoiding "Out of environment space" errors on Windows 95/98

This error can easily occur since the default amount of environment space is
typically insufficient to run Tomcat.  Here are a couple of ways to avoid it.

  A. If you use the MS-DOS Prompt to start Tomcat, execute Programs ->
     MS-DOS Prompt.  Right-click the MS-DOS icon on the left of the title bar
     and select Properties at the bottom of the menu.  In the MS-DOS Prompt
     Properties dialog select the Memory tab.  In the "Initial environment:"
     field, set a sufficiently high number.  If you are not sure, 3072 should
     be plenty.  Click OK and close the MS-DOS Prompt window.  Execute
     Programs -> MS-DOS Prompt again, navigate to the directory where you
     installed Tomcat.  Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable if not set
     already.  You should be able to execute "bin\startup" and "bin\shutdown"
     to start and stop Tomcat without getting an "Out of environment space"
     error.

  B. If you want to start Tomcat by double clicking a batch file such as
     startup.bat, you should right-click on the desired batch file in Windows
     Explorer and select Properties to open the MS-DOS Prompt Properties
     dialog.  Select the Memory tab and set the "Initial environment:" as
     described above.  You may want to also select the Program tab and check
     "Close on exit".  Then click OK.  A shortcut with these settings will be
     created in same directory with the same base name as the batch file.  You
     should be able to double-click the shortcut or the batch file to execute
     without getting an "Out of environment space" error.  If you wish to
     execute startup.bat and shutdown.bat in this fashion, you will need to do
     the above for both files.  In addition, you need to provide for setting
     JAVA_HOME.  This may be done by adding a "SET JAVA_HOME=path to your jdk"
     line to your autoexec.bat or to the startup.bat and shutdown.bat files
     themselves.

6.6 URL's are now case sensitive on all operating systems

As of Tomcat 3.2, URL's are case sensitive for all operating systems,
including operating systems which have case insensitive file systems, such as
Windows.  This represents a change from Tomcat 3.1, where URL's were case
insensitive on case insensitive OS's.  This was done for a number of reasons,
security and portability among them.

A "non-portable" web application, i.e. one with case mismatches, which worked
on a case insensitive OS under Tomcat 3.1 will show its non-portability when
run under Tomcat 3.2 and later.

This can also cause URL's that look correct to actually be incorrect.  In
Windows Explorer, a directory whose name fits within the MS-DOS 8.3 format
may be displayed using a "formated" name.  For example, a directory named
"MYDIR" may display as "Mydir".  A URL like "http://localhost/mysite/Mydir/
index.jsp" would return "File Not Found" because the correct URL would be
"http://localhost/mysite/MYDIR/index.jsp".  If you find URL's being
mysteriously "not found", check for case mismatch.  Use the Windows Explorer
Properties dialog or an MS-DOS window to check the actual case of the file
and directory names.

This can cause an additional problem when Tomcat is used with a case
insensitive web server, such as IIS, where the web server serves the static
content.  The web server could serve a static page with mismatched case in the
URL. If that static page contains relative links to resources served by
Tomcat, then invoking those links would carry the mismatched case to Tomcat
where it cause the resource not to be found.

6.7 Generated Configuration Files for Web Connectors

Tomcat normally generates configuration files like "mod-jk.conf" to reflect
the contexts that are defined.  However, the generated files may not reflect
all configuration settings found inside the web application deployment
descriptor file (web.xml) for your web application.  The simplest solution
to this is to forward all requests for a particular context to Tomcat, which
is the default behavior.  If you do not forward all requests, you will need to
configure any such settings that are relevant directly into your web
server's configuration files.

This is a known limitation of the design of the web connectors for Tomcat 3.2
and later, and will be addressed by the introduction of the MOD_WARP connector
in Tomcat 4.x.

6.8 Limitation on Form Based Login

If the pages you specify for <form-login-page> or <form-error-page> are within
the area protected by a security constraint, Tomcat 3.3 will be unable to
display them.  As a side effect of this problem, you will not be able to use
a URL pattern of "/*" to protect your entire web application when using form
based login.

A workaround is to set up your web application with the form login page and
form error page in the document root directory, place all other pages in one
or more subdirectories, and establish security constraints to protect the
subdirectories.

6.9 Limitation on Document Base Paths

Tomcat 3.3 is unable to support Windows SMB paths in a <Context> directive
like this:

        <Context path="/ctx" docBase="\\machine\share\path" />

although this approach was supported in Tomcat 3.1, and is supported in
Tomcat 4.x.  A workaround is to establish a drive mapping to "\\machine\share"
and define your context like this:

        <Context path="/ctx" docBase="r:\path" />

where "r:" is mapped to this share.

=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

Tomcat is a servlet container and JavaServer Pages(tm) implementation.  It may
be used stand alone, or in conjunction with several popular web servers:
- Apache, version 1.3 or later (FIXME - tested with 2.0alpha?)
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 4.0 or later
- Microsoft Personal Web Server, version 4.0 or later
- Netscape Enterprise Server, version 3.0 or later

You should read the License Agreement (in the LICENSE file of the top level
directory), which applies to all software included in this release.

=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLING TOMCAT

Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Environment conformant to JRE 1.1 or later,
including any Java2 platform system.  If you wish to develop applications,
you will need a Java compiler, such as the one included in a Java Development
Kit 1.1 or later environment, including JDKs conformant with Java2.

For detailed information about installing and configuring Tomcat, point your
browser at file "doc/uguide/tomcat_ug.html" under the directory into which
you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
3.  RUNNING TOMCAT

3.1 Setting Up Your Environment

In order to run Tomcat, you must have installed a compliant Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK), and have configured your PATH
environment variable so that the "java" command is recognized.  For detailed
instructions, see the documentation that came with your JRE or JDK package.

For best results, you should also set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to
point at the directory in which your Java Development Kit or Java Runtime
Environment installation exists, and also set the TOMCAT_HOME environment
variable to point at the directory into which you installed Tomcat.  These
settings are currently required on Windows platforms.  Example commands:

        * UNIX Systems (sh or bash):
                export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.2.2
                export TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat

        * UNIX Systems (csh):
                setenv JAVA_HOME/usr/local/jdk1.2.2
                setenv TOMCAT_HOME /usr/local/tomcat

        * WINDOWS Systems:
                set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.2.2
                set TOMCAT_HOME=c:\tomcat

For convenience, you may also wish to add the "bin" directory under TOMCAT_HOME
to your PATH environment variable, so that the startup and shutdown scripts are
immediately available:

        * UNIX Systems (sh or bash):
                export PATH=$TOMCAT_HOME/bin:$PATH

        * UNIX Systems (csh):
                setenv PATH $TOMCAT_HOME/bin:$PATH

        * WINDOWS Systems:
                set PATH=%TOMCAT_HOME%/bin;%PATH%

3.2 Starting Tomcat

To start Tomcat on a Unix system, type one of the following commands:

    startup.sh                   <-- If $TOMCAT_HOME/bin is on your path

    $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh  <-- Otherwise

To start Tomcat on a Windows system, type one of the following commands:

    startup                      <-- If %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin is on your path

    %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\startup    <-- Otherwise

Alternatively, you can use the "tomcat.sh" script (Unix) or "tomcat.bat" script
(Windows) directly.  This script is used by the startup and shutdown scripts,
and also includes additional options.  For example, on a Unix system:

    tomcat.sh start

    $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/tomcat.sh start

Now, point your browser at the following URL to begin using Tomcat:

        http://localhost:8080


3.3 Stopping Tomcat

To stop Tomcat on a Unix system, type one of the following commands:

    shutdown.sh                  <-- If $TOMCAT_HOME/bin is on your path

    $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh <-- Otherwise

To stop Tomcat on a Windows system, type one of the following commands:

    shutdown                     <-- If %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin is on your path

    %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\shutdown   <-- Otherwise


3.4 Troubleshooting Startup Problems

3.4.1 Out Of Environment Space

On a Windows 95/98 machine, you may see an "Out of Environment Space"
error message when starting the server (or the separate DOS window might
appear and very quickly disappear).  This is caused by Windows providing
too small a space for environment variables.  To work around this limitation:
- Click on the MS-DOS icon at the upper left corner of the window
- Select the "Properties" option from this menu
- Click on the "Memory" tab
- Adjust the value in the Initial Environment drop down box to at least 2816
- Click the OK button
- Close the MS-DOS window and open a new one (to make the changes take effect)
- Start the server as described above

3.4.2 Debugging Other Startup Problems

To debug other problems starting the server, it is sometimes more convenient
to run Tomcat in the same window (the startup scripts normally run Tomcat as a
detached process on Unix, or in a separate window on Windows).  To disable this
feature, start Tomcat like this on a Unix system

    tomcat.sh run                <-- If $TOMCAT_HOME/bin is on your path

or

    $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/tomcat.sh run

On a Windows system, you would type

    tomcat run                  <-- If %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin is on your path

or

    %TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\tomcat run

4.  APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING TOMCAT

Preliminary information on using Tomcat for developing Servlet/JSP based
applications is provided in the included Application Developer's Guide.
Point your browser at file "doc/appdev/index.html" under the directory into
which you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.

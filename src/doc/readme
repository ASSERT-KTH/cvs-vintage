=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

Tomcat is a servlet container and JavaServer Pages(tm) implementation.  It may
be used stand alone, or in conjunction with several popular web servers:
- Apache, version 1.3 or later (FIXME - tested with 2.0alpha?)
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 4.0 or later
- Microsoft Personal Web Server, version 4.0 or later
- Netscape Enterprise Server, version 3.0 or later

You should read the License Agreement (in the LICENSE file of the top level
directory), which applies to all software included in this release.


=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLING AND RUNNING TOMCAT

Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Environment conformant to JRE 1.1 or later,
including any Java2 platform system.  If you wish to develop applications,
you will need a Java compiler, such as the one included in a Java Development
Kit 1.1 or later environment, including JDKs conformant with Java2.

For detailed information about installing and running Tomcat, point your
browser at file "doc/uguide/tomcat_ug.html" under the directory into which
you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
3.  APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING TOMCAT

Preliminary information on using Tomcat for developing Servlet/JSP based
applications is provided in the included Application Developer's Guide.
Point your browser at file "doc/appdev/index.html" under the directory into
which you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
4.  NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE

Many new features have been added to Tomcat since the 3.0 release.  Among the
most important are:

- Connectors for using Tomcat to run servlets with Microsoft's IIS
  and Netscape's NES web server, as well as Apache and stand-alone.

- Automatic generation of configuration files for Apache integration.

- Automatic deployment of applications delivered as Web ARchive (WAR)
  files.  To deploy an application, copy the WAR file to the
  $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory and restart Tomcat, after which the
  WAR file will be automatically expanded.  To remove an application,
  remove the expanded directory (and the WAR file) for that application.

- Automatic servlet reloading when servlet classes are changed in
  WEB-INF/classes or WEB-INF/lib/*.jar.  This support can be configured
  on a per-web-application basis.

- Enhanced support for logging on a per-Tomcat-component basis.

- Minimal administration tool, allowing new web applications to be deployed
  into a running Tomcat environment, as well as removing existing applications.

- Command line tool (jspc) to compile the JSP pages that comprise your
  application ahead of time.

- Substantially improved installation and development documentation.


=============================================================================
5.  KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

5.1 Using An Absolute Path as Document Root Under Windows

In the TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml file, you can declare a relative or absolute
directory pathname for the docRoot attribute.  If you wish to use an absolute
pathname on a Windows system, you MUST include the drive letter in order to
conform to Java's definition of an absolute path on this platform:

    GOOD:  c:\mydirectory\mydocroot
    GOOD:  c:/mydirectory/mydocroot
    BAD:   \mydirectory\mydocroot
    BAD:   /mydirectory/mydocroot

Under Unix, absolute pathnames must begin with a slash ('/') character.

5.2 Container Managed Security

Tomcat 3.1 has an experimental implementation of container managed security,
as described in the Servlet API Specification, version 2.2, section 11.  Please
note the following information about this implementation:

- BASIC authentication appears to work correctly, but has not been
  extensively tested.  Please report any bugs you encounter here
  at <http://jakarta.apache.org/bugs>.  The example application has
  a protected area defined at the following URL:

	http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/security/protected

  which can be accessed by any user defined in the configuration file
  $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml that has been granted the
  appropriate roles.

  WARNING:  Basic authentication is not suitable for general security
  use across the Internet, or across other insecure networks, because
  usernames and passwords are sent encoded, but not encrypted, with
  every single request.

- FORM based authentication is partially supported, although there are
  known bugs and specification compliance issues.  This implementation
  is *not* suitable for general application use.

  If you wish to participate in debugging and enhancing this portion of
  Tomcat, please subscribe to the TOMCAT-DEV mailing list, and assist in
  locating and fixing all of the outstanding problems.

- DIGEST authentication and HTTPS client authentication (i.e. SSL)
  are not supported in this release.

=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

Tomcat is a servlet container and JavaServer Pages(tm) implementation.  It may
be used stand alone, or in conjunction with several popular web servers:
- Apache, version 1.3 or later (FIXME - tested with 2.0alpha?)
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, version 4.0 or later
- Microsoft Personal Web Server, version 4.0 or later
- Netscape Enterprise Server, version 3.0 or later

You should read the License Agreement (in the LICENSE file of the top level
directory), which applies to all software included in this release.

=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLING AND RUNNING TOMCAT

Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Environment conformant to JRE 1.1 or later,
including any Java2 platform system.  If you wish to develop applications,
you will need a Java compiler, such as the one included in a Java Development
Kit 1.1 or later environment, including JDKs conformant with Java2.

For detailed information about installing and running Tomcat, point your
browser at file "doc/uguide/tomcat_ug.html" under the directory into which
you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.


=============================================================================
3.  APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT USING TOMCAT

Preliminary information on using Tomcat for developing Servlet/JSP based
applications is provided in the included Application Developer's Guide.
Point your browser at file "doc/appdev/index.html" under the directory into
which you unpacked the Tomcat distribution.

5.  KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

6.1 Using An Absolute Path as Document Root Under Windows

In the TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml file, you can declare a relative or absolute
directory pathname for the docRoot attribute.  If you wish to use an absolute
pathname on a Windows system, you MUST include the drive letter in order to
conform to Java's definition of an absolute path on this platform:

    GOOD:  c:\mydirectory\mydocroot
    GOOD:  c:/mydirectory/mydocroot
    BAD:   \mydirectory\mydocroot
    BAD:   /mydirectory/mydocroot

Under Unix, absolute pathnames must begin with a slash ('/') character.

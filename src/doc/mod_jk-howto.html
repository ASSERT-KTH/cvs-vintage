<h2><a name=s2>What is mod_jk?</a></h2>

<p>mod_jk is a replacement to the elderly mod_jserv. It is a completely new
Tomcat-Apache plugin that handles the communication between Tomcat and Apache</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name=s3>Why mod_jk?</a></h2>

<p>Several reasons: </p>

<ul>
 <li><b>mod_jserv was too complex</b>. Because it was ported from Apache/JServ, it
 brought with it lots of JServ specific bits that aren't needed by Apache.
 <li><b>mod_jserv supported only Apache</b>. Tomcat supports many web servers
     through a compatibility layer named the jk library. Supporting two different
     modes of work became problematic in terms of support, documentation and bug
     fixes. mod_jk should fix that.</li>
 <li>The layered approach provided
     by the jk library makes it easier to support both <b>Apache1.3.x <i>and</i>
     Apache2.xx.</b></li>
 <li><b>Better support for SSL</b>. mod_jserv couldn't reliably identify whether a
 request was made via HTTP or HTTPS. mod_jk can, using the newer Ajpv13 protocol.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name=s4>What does it mean to me?</a></h2>

<p>You will need to get to know a new simplified configuration mechanism. The
advantage is that learning this mechanism will give you a head start if you
want to deploy Tomcat on other web servers such as IIS and Netscape (oops,
iPlanet).</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name=s5>Definitions and terminology</a></h2>

<p>During this document I am going to use a few terms, so lets define them:</p>

<table class=inlinetable>
 <tr>
  <th class=inlineth>
  <p>Term</p>
  </th>
  <th class=inlineth>
  <p>Meaning</p>
  </th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>Worker process</p>
  </td>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>A worker is a tomcat instance that is running to serve
  servlet requests coming from the web server. In most cases there is only a
  single worker (the one and only tomcat process) but sometimes you will run
  multiple workers to achieve load balancing or site partitioning. Each worker
  is identified to the web server by the host were it is located, the port
  where it listens and the communication protocol used to exchange messages.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>In process worker</p>
  </td>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>This is a special worker. Instead of working with a Tomcat
  process residing on another process, the web server opens a JVM and executes
  Tomcat inside the web server process address space. Our discussion in this
  document is not going to get into this special worker.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>Web server plugin/tomcat redirector</p>
  </td>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>For Tomcat to cooperate with any web server it needs an
  &quot;agent&quot; to reside in the web server and send him servlet requests.
  This is the web server plugin, and in our case the web server plugin is
  mod_jk. The redirector usually comes in the shape of a DLL/shared object
  module that you should plug into the web server.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>Plugin configuration</p>
  </td>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>We need to configure the web server plugin so that it will
  know where are the different Tomcat workers and to which of them it should
  forward requests. This information accompanied with some internal parameter
  such as the log level comprises the plugin configuration. </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>Web server configuration</p>
  </td>
  <td class=inlinetd>
  <p>Each web server has some configuration that defines how
  behave, e.g. on which port to listen, what files to serve, what web server
  plugins to load, etc. You will need to modify your web server configuration
  to instruct it to load the tomcat redirector.</p>
  </td>

<h2><a name=s6>Configuring Apache to use mod_jk</a></h2>

<p>The configuration includes the following steps: </p>

<ol>
 <li>Remove your old mod_jserv configuration. mod_jk and mod_jserv cannot coexist !!</li>
 <li>Obtaining mod_jk</li>
 <li><i>(optional)</i> Configuring Tomcat to use the Ajpv13 protocol</li>
 <li>Defining workers for mod_jk (or selecting the quick start option)</li>
 <li>Configuring Apache to use mod_jk and configure mod_jk internals (or selecting the quick start option)</li>
 <li>Assigning URLs to be redirected to Tomcat (or selecting the quick start option)</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name=s61>1. Removing the mod_jserv directives</a></h3>
<p class=subsection>
If you've already configured Apache to use mod_jserv, remove any <tt>ApJServMount</tt> directives from your httpd.conf. If you're including <tt>tomcat-apache.conf</tt> or <tt>tomcat.conf</tt>, you'll want to remove them as well - they are specific to mod_jserv.
</p>

<h3><a name=s62>2. Obtaining and building mod_jk</a></h3>
<div class=subsection>
Binaries are available for Linux and Win32 under the bin directory where you obtained
the Tomcat distribution file. For Linux, mod_jk is available as mod_jk.so. For Win32,
mod_jk is available as mod_jk.dll.  If there isn't a prebuilt mod_jk available or
you wish to build your own copy, you can build it yourself from the source.
First, download the <b>Source Distribution</b> for Tomcat. There are a large number
of files in the download directory, but the only one you need is <tt>jakarta-tomcat</tt>.

<h3>On NT</h3>

<p>The redirector was developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, so having this
environment is a prereq if you want to perform a custom build.</p>

<p>The steps that you need to take are: </p>

<ol>
 <li>Change directory to the
     apache1.3/apache2.0 source directory. </li>
 <li>Set an APACHE1_HOME environment variable which points to where your Apache is
   installed.</li>
 <li>Execute the following
     command:<br><br>
     <tt><span>MSDEV mod_jk.dsp /MAKE ALL</span></tt><br><br>
     If msdev is not in your path, enter the full path to msdev.exe. Also, ApacheCore.lib
     is expected to exist in the APACHE1_HOME\src\CoreD and APACHE1_HOME\src\CoreR
     directories before linking will succeed. You will need to build enough of the
     Apache source to create these libraries.</li>
 <li>Copy mod_jk.dll to Apache's modules directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will build both release and debug versions of the redirector plugin
(mod_jk). </p>

<p>An alternative will be to open <tt>mod_jk.dsp</tt> in msdev and build it using the build
menu.</p>

<h3>On UNIX</h3>

<h4>For Apache</h4>

<ol>
 <li>Make sure you have Perl 5 installed. The <tt>apxs</tt> script used to build the module is written in Perl.
 <li>Change directory to <tt>jakarta-tomcat/src/native/apache1.3</tt> (or <tt>apache2.0</tt>).
  <li>Run the <tt>apxs</tt> command that came with your apache distribution (hint: look in /usr/local/apache/bin, /usr/sbin, or wherever you intalled apache). Type the command all on one line.<BR><BR>
  For Solaris:<BR>
  <blockquote><tt>apxs -o mod_jk.so -DSOLARIS -I../jk -I/usr/java/include -I/usr/java/include/solaris -c *.c ../jk/*.c</tt></blockquote>
  <i>On some systems, this will build the module correctly, but will fail at runtime with a </i>"<tt>symbol "fdatasync" not found</tt>"<i>. To fix, add </i><tt>-lposix4</tt><i> just before the </i><tt>-c</tt><i> in the above command.</i><BR><BR>
  For Linux:
  <blockquote><tt>apxs -o mod_jk.so -I../jk -I/usr/local/jdk/include -I/usr/local/jdk/include/linux -c *.c ../jk/*.c</tt></blockquote>
  <i>Your build may fail because the object files from the <tt>../jk</tt> directory have been compiled to the current directory, rather than their source directory. Running </i><tt>gcc -shared -o mod_jk.so *.o</tt><i> should finish the build.</i><BR><BR>
  (If you've installed Java in another directory, adjust accordingly). For other *nixes you should be able to work it out, but remember that <b>the order of the arguments to <tt>apxs</tt> is important!</b>.
  </li>
 <li>Copy mod_jk.so to Apache's libexec directory</li>
</ol>

<h4>For other Webservers</h4>

There are several Makefiles in the other directories under the <tt>jakarta-tomcat/src/native</tt> directory.
</div>

<h3><a name=s63>3. (optional) Configuring Tomcat to use the Ajpv13 protocol</a></h3>
<div class=subsection>
mod_jk can use either the original Ajpv12 protocol or the newer Ajpv13 protocol.
If you choose the latter, you need to activate the &quot;Ajp13&quot; Connection Handler in Tomcat. This
will give you the benefit of a faster protocol and the ability to identify requests made via HTTPS.<BR><BR>
Add the following block to your <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml</tt> file.
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Connector className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Parameter name=&quot;handler&quot; value=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.Ajp13ConnectionHandler&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;Parameter name=&quot;port&quot; value=&quot;8009&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
The <tt>servlet.xml</tt> file already has a block similar to this for Ajp12 connections on port 8007 (as delivered by mod_jserv). Even if you think you're only using Ajp13, you probably don't want to delete this connector - it's required to shut down Tomcat.
</div>
<h3><a name=s64>4. Defining &quot;workers&quot;</a></h3>

<h4>Quick start?</h4>
<div class=subsection>
<p>
In most of simple cases Tomcat can generate the needed Apache configuration.
When Tomcat starts up it will automatically generate
a configuration file for Apache in <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto</tt>.
Most of the time you don't need to do anything but
include this file (appending <tt>&quot;Include TOMCAT_HOME/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto&quot;</tt>)
in your httpd.conf. That's it, you can
now start Tomcat and Apache and access Tomcat from the Apache server.
</p>
<p>
If you have special needs, for example mounting
URL prefixes that are not the default, you can use this file as a base for your
customized configuration and save the results in another file. If you manage
the Apache configuration yourself you'll need to update it whenever you add a
new context.
</p>
<p class=note><b>Tomcat 3.2:</b> you must restart tomcat and apache after adding a new
context; Apache doesn't support configuration changes without a restart. Also
the file <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto</tt> is generated when
tomcat starts, so you'll need to start Tomcat before Apache. Tomcat will
overwrite <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto</tt> each startup so
customized configuration should be kept elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<h4>Configuring workers manually.</h4>
<div class=subsection>
<p>
Workers are configured using the file <tt>TOMCAT_HOME/conf/workers.properties</tt>.
There is a great deal of information in the
<a href="Tomcat-Workers-HowTo.html">workers.properties howto</a> document, and you
should really look at that first. If you're in a hurry however, you can probably get away
with editing the file <tt>workers.properties</tt> and setting the <tt>workers.tomcat_home</tt>, <tt>workers.java_home</tt> and <tt>ps</tt> variables to the correct values for your system.
</p>
</div>

<h3><a name=s65>5. Configure Apache to use mod_jk</a></h3>
<div class=subsection>
<p>Configuring Apache to use mod_jk is done using the Apache server
configuration directives; to get you started, look at the auto-generated
<tt>mod_jk.conf-auto</tt> available in Tomcat's <tt>conf</tt> directory.</p>

<ul>
 <li>You will need to instruct Apache to load Tomcat. This can be done with
 Apache's <tt>LoadModule</tt> and <tt>AddModule</tt> configuration directives.</li>
 <li>You must inform mod_jk the location of your <tt>workers.properties</tt> file.
     Use mod_jk's <tt>JkWorkersFile</tt> configuration directive.</li>
 <li>You should specify a location where mod_jk is going to place its log file
     and a log level to be used. Use the <tt>JkLogFile</tt> and <tt>JkLogLevel</tt>
     configuration directives. Possible log levels are <i>debug</i>, <i>warn</i>,
     <i>error</i> and <i>emerg</i>, but <i>warn</i> should be your default
     selection.</li>
</ul>
A simple example would be to include the following lines in your <tt>httpd.conf</tt> file:
<blockquote><pre>
LoadModule    jk_module  libexec/mod_jk.so
AddModule     mod_jk.c
JkWorkersFile /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat/conf/workers.properties
JkLogFile     /usr/local/apache/logs/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel    warn
</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<h3><a name=s66>6. Assigning URLs to Tomcat</a></h3>
<div class=subsection>
<p>Use mod_jk's JkMount directive to assign specific URLs to Tomcat. In general
the structure of a JkMount directive is:</p>

<pre>
JkMount <i>&lt;URL prefix&gt;</i> <i>&lt;Worker name&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>For example the following directives will send all requests ending in
<tt>.jsp</tt> or beginning with <tt>/servlet</tt> to the &quot;<tt>ajp13</tt>&quot; worker,
but jsp requests to files located in /otherworker will go to &quot;<tt>remoteworker</tt>&quot;.

<blockquote><pre>
JkMount /*.jsp ajp13
JkMount /servlet/* ajp13
JkMount /otherworker/*.jsp remoteworker
</pre></blockquote>
You  can use the <tt>JkMount</tt> directive at the top level or inside <tt>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</tt>
sections of your httpd.conf file.
</div>

You're done! You should now be able to start Tomcat and apache and have them cooperate
to serve servlets and JSP files.
<hr>
<h2><a name=s7>An example configuration</a></h2>
Here's an example configuration which probably reflects many real-world setups. A site
is using Tomcat and Apache with two virtual hosts (one of them using HTTPS as well, which
we're assuming is being handled by mod_ssl).
<BR><BR>
URLs ending in .jsp and beginning with /servlet are handled by Tomcat, the rest are
handled by Apache. The files for each Host are server out of /web/host1 and /web/host2
respectively.<BR><BR>
The example are over-simplified and incomplete but should get you started. Also note the
virtual host setup is new in Tomcat 3.2 - <i>this example won't work with Tomcat 3.1</i>.<BR><BR>

<h2><a name=s8>Troubleshooting and F.A.Q.s</a></h2>

<h3>Q. I can't find mod_jk anywhere. Where is it?</h3>
A. You need to download the <b>Source Distribution</b> of Tomcat and build it yourself.
See <a href="#s62">this section</a> for more information.

<h3>Q. Which protocol should I use? Ajp12 or Ajp13?</h3>
A. Ajp13 is a newer protocol, it's faster, and it works better with SSL. You almost
certainly want to use that. There is more information in the
<a href="Tomcat-Workers-HowTo.html">workers.properties howto</a> document

<h3>Q. Whenever I restart Tomcat, Apache locks up!</h3>
A. The Ajp13 protocol keeps an open socket between Tomcat and Apache. When you restart
Tomcat, you need to restart Apache as well.

<h3>Q. Where can I get more information?</h3>
A. The <a href="Tomcat-Workers-HowTo.html">workers.properties howto</a> document has
considerably more in-depth information than this one, and is worth a look. You could
also try searching the mailing list archives for &quot;mod_jk&quot; or look at the source.

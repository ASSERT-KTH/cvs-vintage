<BODY TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>This document tries to document the design of tomcat-3 and the
reasons behind this. Tomcat is the result of a long evolution, with
many people with different perspectives contributing code and ideas.
Most of the code in tomcat was rewritten 2 or 3 times in the last
year, with many experiments and prototypes developed off-line. It is
important to distinguish between the actual patterns and ideas and
the implementation - the later will change and did changed a lot.</P>
<HR>
<H2>2. Goals</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Correctness</B>. Implement the Servlet and JSP
	specification as accurate as possible. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Code quality</B> and clarity must match Apache's
	standards. We also want a bit more comments and documentation :-)</P>
	<LI><P><B>Security</B>. User applications will run in applet-like
	sandboxes, and shouldn't be able to get out of the box. Servlet API
	is the only API ( I am aware of ) that can provide this kind of
	feature. That means an ISP should be able to let its users to deploy
	WARs without having to worry about the system security or about the
	possible interference between the users. It also means companies can
	use JSPs and applications without having to review them for security
	flaws ( and in complex web servers this is extremely difficult and
	expensive ). 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Embedability</B>. The code must be embedable, acting as a
	servlet container for various applications. There are 2 services
	tomcat provides - servlet services for Web servers ( like Apache )
	and http and servlet services for standalone applications. Tomcat
	should be usable as a component providing web services for
	applications ( in the form of the standalone server or in
	association with a web server), allowing applications to provide
	servlet-based interfaces. For example it should be possible to
	create a web-based configuration for an IDE by just starting tomcat
	and using servlets that access the application's internal APIs. We
	also want to embed tomcat in existing web servers, providing generic
	web programming using servlet and JSP for Apache, etc.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Performance</B>. As in Apache, the performance is less
	important than code quality and must come from using the right
	algorithms and data structures, not by low-level hacking. We want to
	focus on the critical path and be sure we add the smallest overhead
	possible, while making sure that only applications that make use of
	special features are paying the price for it.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Integration</B> with the current Web infrastructure. Web
	applications will run on the web, and we want to make sure we do can
	work with existing code and provide a smooth transition. We want to
	take advantage of the existing optimizations and maturity of web
	servers like apache, and make sure most of the modules and
	extensions work well with tomcat.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Modular structure</B>. The core should be small and as
	simple as possible ( but not simpler :-), and the most functionality
	must be provided in modules. By choosing the right modules we can
	use it in toasters or big servers. Multiple versions of the same
	module can be optimized for various VMs or special environments. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Reusable components</B> wherever possible. Functionality
	that is generic enough should have minimal dependencies on tomcat
	core. This even more visible starting with tomcat3.3, where we tried
	to clearly identify the &quot;modules&quot; and build a collection
	of general-purpose and independent components that can be used in
	any other project without any relation with tomcat. Having a
	component that is reviewed, tested and enhanced in more than one
	project is worth the price of slightly looser integration, and the
	facade pattern helps integrating independent components without
	changing their interfaces ( making them dependent on tomcat).</P>
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>3. Design Patterns</H2>
<H3>Chain of responsibility</H3>
<P>&quot;Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by
giving more than one object a chacne to handle it&quot;. In our case
the servlet API implementation and the request processing ( mapping,
auth, etc) are handler by the Interceptors. The operation is chained
and passed along until one interceptor handles it.</P>
<P>Interceptors are the mechanism used to implement and extend
tomcat. It avoids coupling the sender of the request ( tomcat core,
servlets ) with the actual receiver ( one of the modules handling the
requested operation ). The module that actually provide the
implementation is not known. 
</P>
<P>There are 2 important reasons for choosing this pattern for
tomcat.</P>
<P>The exact same pattern is used in IIS in the form of filters, NES
as SAFs and Apache as modules and hooks. This is the main tool of
extending those servers. It also allows the integration between
tomcat and web servers ( since the same pattern is used tomcat, will
be able to reuse existing code and provide server extensions ). The
fact that this works well in existing high performance and the
extensibility it provides was a very strong argument.</P>
<P>We also want to integrate tomcat with applications and external
packages that may provide various services. This will be a deployment
decision, and the core and basic modules shouldn't depend on any
particular handler implementation. An example is authentication - the
service can be provided by the default tomcat interceptor that use a
static xml file, by the native web server, by JAAS, or a private API
if tomcat is embedded in applications.</P>
<P>The implementation consists in Interceptors and Events ( possibly
in 3.3 or 3.4 ). See also Strategy. 
</P>
<H3>Strategy</H3>
<P>&quot;Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make
them interchangeable&quot;. 
</P>
<P>This allows an easy evolution of tomcat and simplifies the
development in an open source environment. We were able to isolate
the original implementation of tomcat 3.0 and re-implement individual
components while maintaining the overall stability. We started with a
code that was very hard to read because of many incremental changes
and fixes, but was extremely stable and very well tested. By using
this pattern we moved the ugly algorithm in a module and then
provided better implementations. 
</P>
<P>Separating the actual algorithm from the code that calls it
allowed us to focus on what was important for the problem, and remove
the dependencies. 
</P>
<P>It allows us to provide alternative implementations for each
service ( we have 2-3 authentication modules, 3-4 mapping
interceptors were developed and expect more improvements) and decide
on a particular implementation based on stability and performance,
after the code is ready. 
</P>
<P>We can choose a set of components that are best tuned for our
application - for example we can use a mapping interceptor ( that
parses and matches the request against a set of mapping rules ) that
is optimized for memory usage or one tuned for speed. An ISP will
choose a specialized algorithms that is able to deal with large
number of web applications - for example by loading the mappings for
a certain application only when needed ( and maintaining a cache of
mappings for frequent access)</P>
<P>One particular application is the use of existing algorithms
implemented in native servers. Most web servers have highly tuned
algorithms ( not a surprise ), and this seems great for lazy
programmers - we can get very fast code without too much work. 
</P>
<P>This is implemented in RequestInterceptors - see also Chain Of
Responsibility. 
</P>
<H3>Observer</H3>
<P>This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between core objects
( Context, ContextManager ) and modules ( Interceptors). When the
core object change it's state all the dependents will be notified and
updated automatically.</P>
<P>Tomcat state changes at runtime - and all the modules interested
in a particular state can be notified and change their internal (
possibly optimized ) data structures. That means the core can be kept
simple, without advanced data structures, while modules can use Trees
( JDK1.2 collections) or other complex representations. 
</P>
<P>It also enable us to keep the core compatible with JDK1.1, while
taking advantage of all &quot;modern&quot; features ( this works
together with the Strategy pattern in separating the algorithm/data
from the caller)</P>
<P>It also allows a simpler core, without any optimization that may
affect the code readability. The complex structures are in modules -
the Observer will keep the information in sync. 
</P>
<P>The implementation is done in ContextInterceptor ( that will
probably be replaced by a more standard Event/Listener model in 3.3
or 3.4). ContextManager, Context, Container will send notifications
each time their state changes, and interceptors will alter their
internal state.</P>
<H3>Adapter</H3>
<P>It converts the interfaces of a class into the interface
tomcat.core expects. This is the main enabler for &quot;integration
with other applications&quot; requirement.</P>
<P>Adapter is very important for allowing tomcat to reuse external
APIs and modules, without requiring them to change and without
changing tomcat ( and making it dependent of a particular
API/application). It allows us to use multiple APIs for various tasks
- for example authentication can be done using JAAS, J2EE APIs, other
proprietary APIs or using the web server. Instead of hard-coding a
Realm interface and attempting to fit everything under it ( JAAS is a
good candidate for such a &quot;generic auth API &quot;, but it's too
much for simple cases ) we just build adapters for whatever API we
have to integrate with.</P>
<P>This pattern is also used in integration with the web server, with
Request, Response, Container acting as adapters for the equivalent
objects in web servers.</P>
<P>This is used in conjunction with &quot;Chain of responsibility&quot;
and &quot;Strategy&quot; to enable &quot;lazy programming&quot; ( or
reuse of existing APIs :-).</P>
<P>A number of Interceptors are using Adapter for their
implementation. J2EEInterceptor is a very good example of adapter -
on one side it knows tomcat interface ( Interceptor), and the other
side knows J2EE interfaces. 
</P>
<H3>Proxy</H3>
<P>&quot;It provides a &quot;surrogate&quot; or placeholder for
another object to control access to it&quot;. This is the main tool
in isolating the tomcat internals from servlets and user
applications. While some form of class loader hacks can also be used
to enhance that, this pattern is a very clean mechanism and combined
with the Facade provides many other advantages. 
</P>
<P>It also has an important role in performance, by allowing us to
delay expensive operations until they are needed ( String creation )
and use the more efficient interface in core ( see also Facade). 
</P>
<P>The Servlet API was designed for easy to use and security for
application developers, while the constraints and requirements in
tomcat.core are very different.</P>
<P>This pattern is used in JDK1.3 to create a type-safe
implementation of interfaces ( no down-casting allowed ).</P>
<P><B>Why?</B> Security was the original reason, but this pattern is
at the core of many performance optimizations and will allow a large
number of features. 
</P>
<H3>Facade</H3>
<P>Converts the interface of a class into another. In particular,
this is used to present web applications with the (right) servlet
API, while using more efficient interfaces for the core.</P>
<P>The &quot;facade&quot; name was used ( wrongly ) in many security
discussions and in all interfaces, in fact &quot;Proxy&quot; is
responsible for security while facade is important for performance
and to implement the servlet API on top of a set of internal APIs.
For example HttpServletRequest combines access to a number of core
interfaces.</P>
<P><B>Why? </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The servlet API has
certain goals and requirement that are oriented toward the servlet
developer. The web server and tomcat.core have different
requirements, and by using the right API we can provide a number of
optimizations. For example it is possible to avoid String over-use,
to use more specialized components, and to use adapters for the
(native)</SPAN> web servers.</P>
<P>Another very important benefit of Facade consist in insuring an
independence between the current servlet API ( that change with a
certain speed ) and the internal representation, and also allows one
tomcat instance to support multiple &quot;profiles&quot; of servlet
API. For example the transition between servlet 2.2 and 2.3 can be
smooth, by allowing 2.2 webapps to run in the same container. This
way the users will not have to rewrite ( or recompile ) all their
applications every time the spec changes. This can allow tomcat 3.3
to support both servlet 2.2 and servlet 2.3 APIs.</P>
<HR>
<H2>4. Main Components ( tomcat.core )</H2>
<H3>Request/Response</H3>
<P>This is the tomcat representation of a request. It acts as an
&quot;Adapter&quot; for the underlying application's representation -
in the case of a web server it is the java representation of
(request_rec *) for example, if tomcat is embedded in a non-web
application it represent the application's notion of request.</P>
<P>This is a passive object, with all operations delegated to
modules. It is important to make as much as possible &quot;lazy&quot;
evaluations, and keeps the code very simple.</P>
<P>The objects are not a replication of HttpServletRequest and
HttpServletResponse. The javax interfaces are designed for web
application developers, while core have different needs. It would be
very difficult to implement HttpServletRequest as an adapter for
request_rec, and it would have a big impact on performance to be
restricted to the String-based representation ( that is required for
applications - security reasons, etc).</P>
<P>For example, in tomcat 3.2 we started to expose the internal
buffers and we'll make more use of this - instead of using the
Stream/Writer interfaces, core components will have direct control
over the buffering and char/byte translation. 
</P>
<P>XXX It may be a good idea for the core to use concepts similar
with web servers - i.e. only Request, and add Connection to represent
the http connection data. The only reason to have Request/Response is
to match the servlet model, but the role of core is to match the
model used by the web server. A picture would be great. 
</P>
<H3>OutputBuffer</H3>
<P>The idea is to have full control over tomcat buffering and over
char/byte translation, as this is one of the most expensive
operations ( according to empirical tests ). It should allow to plug
external byte/char convertors. As we know, multiple copy from buffer
to buffer proved to be an important factor in many systems. It
doesn't show up in tomcat 3.2 because other factors are too big, but
as we approach the limits it will be one of the most important issue.</P>
<P>An important feature will be the integration of jasper and other
template systems, where &quot;static&quot; text can be delivered to
the server directly, without intermediary buffers, and the binary
representation ( encoding) can be pre-computed.</P>
<H3>MessageBytes</H3>
<P>This is a very special and important component of tomcat3. The
first problem it tried to solve was the conversion from byte to
chars. The charset is known very late ( either when Content-Type
header is parsed or even later, when the user sets it in servlet
2.3), and converting the received bytes to Strings can't be done
(corectly ) until the encoding is determined.</P>
<P>MessageBytes have another benefit - it's a great mechanism to
avoid Garbage Collection costs. Most of the time the user will not
access all the headers, and probably neither most of the request
information ( url components, etc). That means a &quot;HelloWorld&quot;
servlet ( or any servlet that just display some info) will require no
String allocations when MessageBytes are used - as oposed to 30-40
Strings allocated ( and GC ) before.</P>
<P>Another ( probably less visible ) benefit is the parsing of the
request. Parsing using String proved to lead to inefficient code -
Java provides general purpose utilities like StringTokenizer or
substring() / indexOf(), but they are designed as &quot;general
purpose&quot;, with different goals in mind. The parsing code in
tomcat 3.0 used those mechanisms and that resulted in 100+ String
allocations per request.</P>
<P>Note that String is a very important class in Java - it have the
special characteristic of beeing &quot;imutable&quot;. That has big
implications from a security point of view, and most Servlet API
methods are using String as result type/parameter. On the other side
String is extremely expensive for server-side operation - it can't be
recycled. See also the discussion on GarbageCollection and memory. 
</P>
<H3>Context</H3>
<P>Context is the representation of a web application. It have all
the properties that are definable in web.xml and server.xml. 
</P>
<P>The current implementation is complex and has much more than that
- this have to change.</P>
<P>The context is associated with a Request after the contextMap()
callback completes. By default the mapping interceptor ( SimpleMapper
in the default case ) will implement this hook, but other
interceptors can provide extra functionality ( support for ~user,
dynamic addition of contexts when the first request is made, etc ) 
</P>
<H3>Container</H3>
<P>It represent a group of URLs sharing a common set of properties.
It's analog with per_dir configuration in apache. The &quot;standard&quot;
properties in servlet spec are the handler ( specified in servlet
mappings) and the security properties. 
</P>
<P>The Container is associated with a Request after the requestMap()
hook completes. SimpleMapper is the &quot;core&quot;<BR>implementation
of this hook, providing support for prefix, exact and extension
mappings. Other interceptors can provide optimized mappings for
particular subsets ( like JspIntercepor ) or implement custom mapping
schemes. 
</P>
<P>This is a very important operation ( it should be the most
expensive part of the processing - unfortunately we still have to
eliminate few other hotspots before this will happen ). We exepect
alternate implementations using more advanced data structures and
alghoritms ( Trees, etc ). See also the discussion on &quot;evolution&quot;.
</P>
<P>In tomcat 3.3 it is possible to specify per context and container
interceptors - after the mapping, tomcat will know what is the
container where the request belongs and can invoke specialized
interceptors defined only for that particular set of URLs. This is
similar with what all other web servers provide ( the order is
similar with NES). 
</P>
<H3>ContextManager</H3>
<P>Main entry point for tomcat execution. It coordinates the activity
of modules. 
</P>
<P>In tomcat, the application embedding tomcat ( web server, generic
application, tomcat standalone server) have control over execution.
Embedding tomcat requires an adapter that will construct the
Request/Response adapters and use ContextManager to process the
request.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>XXX Probably a better name would be Server, or TomcatContainer. 
</P>
<H3>Interceptor</H3>
<P>The interceptors represents the building blocks and extension
mechansim for tomcat. Most of tomcat functionality is implemented
using modules. Modules operate on tomcat's core objects and can hook
in and extend tomcat. They are designed around &quot;Chain of
Responsibility&quot; and &quot;Strategy&quot; patterns, and inspired
from Apache hooks, with influences from ISAPI ( filters ) and NSAPI (
saf) . As you know most of Apache ( including the core ) is
implemented using a simple hook mechanism. 
</P>
<P>One interesting sub-project is to make sure interceptors are
interoperable with major web server mechansims - and play the same
role as mod_perl for example: allow easy server extension using Java
( i.e. provide access to all the full power of native server
modules). 
</P>
<P>You can control all aspects of request processing - parsing,
authentication, authorization, sessions, response commit ( before
headers are sent), buffer commit ( before any buffer is sent - it can
be used to support HTTP1.1 for example !), before and after body.</P>
<P>Interceptors are also used to provide integration with web servers
( in tomcat &lt;=3.2 a special &quot;Connector&quot; interface was
used, but we found that Connector was in fact a subset of Interceptor
and web integration requires more then just start/stop, so using the
same mechanism is a better idea).</P>
<P>Currently tomcat defines a number of hooks - other will be added
as needed:</P>

	<LI><P>requestMap</P>
	<LI><P>XXX add the other, descrition</P>
</UL>
<H3>Helpers ( tomcat.helpers )</H3>
<P>In order to keep the core as simple and readable as possible, the
few functions that are implemented inside core ( instead of using
interceptors ) are implemented in specialized helpers. For example
reading the form data, encoding, etc. The helpers are grouped by
functionality and the intention is to allow easy evolution - it is
possible to rewrite or replace them with minimal effect on the rest
of tomcat. This is one way to make sure team development works and
new contributors can improve tomcat without the fear of broking the
core.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each web request is received by the web
adapter, which will provide the Request/Response adapters. It will
then call ContextManager.service(), and tomcat core will begin
processing the request. A similar path happens for request that are
not generated by a HTTP transaction - like sub-requests or non-web
requests ( when tomcat is embedded in applications != web servers )</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Request parsing. Context Manager will delegate ( &quot;Chain
	of responsibility&quot; ) the parsing to a number of Interceptors,
	each having a chance to process the request. Tomcat provides a
	default implementation based on the mappings defined in the spec and
	static configuration ( server.xml ), and also provide an interceptor
	that will add all directories in webapp automatically. Other
	interceptors may provide other features - like automatically adding
	&quot;~user&quot;, etc. See also the performance discussion. It is
	possible to have different mapping algorithms ( &quot;Strategy&quot;
	), including using the web server native mappers if tomcat is
	integrated with a web server.</P>
	<LI><P>As result of mapping, a number of patterns and rules will be
	applied to the request and to determine a &quot;Container&quot;
	where the request belongs. The container encapsulate a set of
	properties, including the request handler, security constraints, and
	any other special attributes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>ContextManager will then delegate the authorization to a set
	of Interceptors. If a certain role is required, tomcat will call the
	authentication chain, where an adapter to an authentication API will
	do the task ( &quot;Strategy&quot; )</P>
	<LI><P>Handler will be called. Expensive/complex operation will be
	handled by modules ( isUserInRole() for example is handled by the
	authorization chain ). This is the place where more filtering can be
	done ( like in Jigsaw or JWS servlet chains ), but so far we haven't
	found the need.</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>During request processing, tomcat will send
notifications (&quot;Observer&quot;) to interested modules about the
current stage of the processing, for example allowing the modules to
set transactions contexts ( J2EE interceptor ) or instrument tomcat (
timing <B>individual</B> operations for fine tuning ).</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This model is identical with the one used in Apache,
IIS and NES ( we tried to represent all notifications, so it tries to
be a union, not intersection). <B>Why? </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Performance
was the original reason, and the fact that the model was well-known
and polished, so more trust-worthy then alternative models. It also
turned out that the code organization improved a lot by using the
&quot;Strategy&quot; pattern ( compared with tomcat 3.0 ), and many
optimizations became possible. </SPAN>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium">Another reason is related
with the idea of making tomcat a real web-server extension, allowing
people to develop web server modules ( filter, SAF, hooks) in java
using a clean API. There are many ways to implement a web server, but
this design choose Apache, IIS and NES as model, and tries to allow
bi-directional code reuse.</P>

<H3>Adding custom modules</H3>
<H3>Revolution by Evolution</H3>
<P>By using the &quot;Strategy&quot; pattern it is possible to
provide alternative alghoritms and implementations without affecting
the core modules. In time the new &quot;strategies&quot; can be
tested ( by first using them on experimental sytes, then in
production ) and eventually replace the &quot;core&quot; modules. 
</P>
<P>Tomcat is designed such that the core will have a minimal role in
how the request is processed. We try to keep the number of methods
and structures as small as possible, while &quot;evolving&quot; the
core based on the use cases and needs of various modules. We expect
that 3.3 or 3.4 will have a stable core.</P>
<P>This method allowed a smooth evolution from tomcat3.0 who had a
very complex and ugly (!) code, due to numerous additions and fixes.
It is a standard form of refactoring that proved very useful.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<H2>7. Reusable Components ( tomcat.util )</H2>
<P>Tomcat tries as much as possible to keep most of the code in
standalone components, that have no dependency on tomcat.core. For
example, the class loader, the session manager, the TCP server,
authentication - all of them can easily be used in different
architectures, and don't (shouldn't ) have any reference to core
interfaces.</P>
<P>There are many reasons for this: we think tomcat should focus on
implementing the servlet API and shouldn't reinvent the wheel, and we
also think all those components should be generic enough to be used
in other servers.</P>
<P>For example, most servlet container allows you to plug in a
session manager. Session manager have ( shouldn't have ) too much
need for knowing about the container internals - it is a special form
of object database. Most of the time is better to write code
independent of a particular container and using adapters to hook into
different containers.</P>

<H2>8. Security</H2>
<P>XXX Move to separate document! 
</P>
<P>The Proxy and FacadeManager plays a very important role in
insuring security, by providing control of the communication between
webapps and tomcat internals. It is possible to augment that with a
special class loader mechanism ( for paranoid administrators), but
most of the information that is available suggest the proxy is a very
effective design pattern for this.</P>
<P>Since tomcat.core runs with special (java) privileges, it is
important to make sure the code is safe and the user can't call
arbitrary methods. That will require a serious review over what
methods are public, and how internal object instances can be accessed
from outside. FacadeManager should be the only point of entry.</P>
<P>We do need to provide a certain internal API to applications that
will allow enhanced performance - for example Jasper can make use of
the internal buffers, etc.</P>
<H3>Existing risks and problems</H3>

	<DT>Isolation. It is possbile for an application to store the
	reference to the HttpServletRequests it receives in a Hashtable. If
	the server is using recycling, the &quot;bad&quot; application will
	end up with references to all active requests, and will be able to
	access parameters and informations of other web applications. 
	</DT><DD>
	In tomcat the HttpServletRequest is a proxy and a facade for the
	real request. Tomcat will recycle the Request object, and can (
	based on a config option) create new HttpServletRequestFacades for
	each request.</DD><DT>
	Constructor access. It is possible that an application will use the
	current internal APIs to gain unauthorized access and call internal
	APIs</DT><DD>
	The only way to get access to internal APIs is using a special
	context/request attribute. We allow only &quot;trusted&quot;
	applications to call the method, and return null if the trusted flag
	is not set. We need to carefully review the code to be sure no other
	way to access the internals is possible, and reduce the number of
	public constructors and public methods. We also need to add a (
	JDK1.1 compatible ) mechanism to do security checks when objects are
	constructed. ( for example add a TomcatSecurity object with empty
	methods for 1.1 and using TomcatPermission and the 1.2 security
	system for 1.2. 
	</DD><DT>
	DOS - large body with POST data</DT><DD>
	Tomcat will read the full body when a POST is processed. We need to
	set upper limits or at least warn of possible abuse.</DD><DT>
	DOS - general</DT><DD>
	There are many possible DOS attacks, we need to identify them and
	provide mechanisms to reduce the effect.</DD><HR>

<H2>9. Embedding tomcat</H2>
<P>Use the tomcat APIs to create ContextManager and set it up or stop
it. Integration with your configuration API is very simple - tomcat
doesn't care how you set it up, as long as the right object are
created and the setter methods are called.</P>
<P>All integration is done using the &quot;Adapter&quot; pattern -
the Interceptors provide you with hooks into all tomcat internals,
and you can control every aspect of request processing.</P>
<HR>
<H2>10. Integration with Web servers</H2>
<P>Most commercial web sites run on one of the 4 big web servers, and
we want to make sure tomcat can work well with those. After all, most
people are using servlets for web applications :-)</P>
<P>There are huge problems, even with the current architecture. For
example the mapping defined in servlet 2.2 is different from the
mapping used in the current web servers, form based login is very
difficult to integrate ( and will require a lot of native code to
protect non-java resources using the same authentication ).</P>
<P>Most of the problems still require a lot of work, but we hope that
the current architecture will be able to handle that. A bigger goal
will be to transform the Interceptors into real web server
extensions, so people can develop hooks/modules/SAF/filters in java
instead of C ( or mod_perl ).</P>
<H3>Tomcat and other Web Servers 
</H3>
<P>Tomcat design is based on the features of Apache modules/hooks,
ISAPI and NSAPI. We tried to not limit ourself to what is common to
all. In time it is likely that tomcat will have more hooks and
provide the same level of extensibility as the other servers. We
tried to add the hooks by following &quot;when somebody needs it &quot;
rule - and so far a number of callbacks are still to be added.</P>
<P>Please read the Apache, IIS and NES documentations &amp; code, as.
Except for using different names and Java-style for interfaces, the
model is the same. 
</P>
<P>The mapping is:

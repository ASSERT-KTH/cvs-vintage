Feature Additions:

Bug No.  Description

8099     Preserve the query string when redirecting to the welcome page.

         Removed '.sh' extension from Unix shell scripts.

	 (Re-) Open the log files with "append", so that log rotation can
	 be configured to be other than daily.

         Package an Ant compiler adapter that compiles JSPs with the correct
         naming convention and an Ant task which creates .ver files.  These
         tasks allow the Tomcat work directory to be pre-populated with 
         compiled JSPs.

13285	 Added improvements to the admin web-app to include support for vhosts.

Server:

Bug No.  Description

         Bug fixed in SimpleSessionStore in session attribute reloading during
         context reloads.

7770	 Fixed thread race problem in accessing the Hooks.

8092	 Fixed JSP source exposure proplem.

9165	 Fix auto-detection of tomcat.install for certain 1.1.x JDKs.

7654	 Make certain that the Context Classloader is set before a servlet 
	 class is loaded.  This allows JAXP and log4j classes to be created
	 in the constructor of the servlet, instead of in init.

	 Fix problem with multiple Context adds on Context reload under
	 high traffic.

	 Preserve sessions across session reloadings.

	 Fix Cookie case name problem under Windows for Session Cookie.

	 Fix problems with URL normalization when the URL attempts to access
	 a file above the ROOT.

	 Prevent session sharing when switching from HTTPS to HTTP.  This
	 removes a way to hijack sensitive sessions.  The old behavior can
	 be restored by setting the secureCookie="false" attribute on the
	 SessionId element in server.xml.

	 Fix the handling of response.encodeURL("") to conform to the w3 spec.

15894	 Fix race condition on reusing Sessions.

         Updated DecodeInterceptor to treat URL paths containing null
         characters as unsafe.

	 Fix problem where the AccessLog was printing the content-length of the
	 Request instead of the Response.

24123    Fix problem where the AccessLog wasn't logging request that produce
         no output.  Also log the Request's content length for PUT requests.

         Partially update to use commons-logging.

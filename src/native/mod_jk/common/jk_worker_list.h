 * This file includes a list of all the possible workers in the jk library
 * plus their factories. 
 *
 * If you want to add a worker just place it in the worker_factories array
 * with its unique name and factory.
 *
 * If you want to remove a worker, hjust comment out its line in the 
 * worker_factories array as well as its header file. For example, look
 * at what we have done to the ajp23 worker.
 *
 * Note: This file should be included only in the jk_worker controller.
 * Currently the jk_worker controller is located in jk_worker.c

View-Controller base package.

This package contains interfaces and abstract classes which should be
common to all views and controllers. They provide the ability to
work with basic menu, toolbar and statusbar but are not frame specific,
allowing for implementation flexibility. Mail and addressbook can plug
themselves in to provide customized functionality.

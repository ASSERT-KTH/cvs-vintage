Provides Commands and CommandReference classes for email purposes.
<p>
Note that we always use an <b>array</b> of FolderCommandReference objects. This is 
of great importance for the understanding of most Command implementations
making use of FolderCommandReference.
</p>

<p>
The last element of this array always represents the destination folder reference.
All other references in this array, are source references, containing a source folder
reference and an array of message UIDs.
But hey, you might ask: "Why do we have more than one source reference anyway? 
Moving a message from a folder to another does only implies to use a source and
a destination folder...".<br>
This is where Virtual Folders come in the discussion. A Virtual Folder doesn't contain
messages. Instead it has references to a message UID in a specific folder.
So, we come up with an array of folder references with each having an array of
message UIDs.
</p>
<p>
Looking at {@link CopyMessageCommand} you will notice
that we execute the command for every source folder reference. 
</p>
<p>
Make use of {@link FolderCommandAdapter} which is a wrapper class for your convenience.

# The current JDK does not contain the correct date pattern characters
# for localised date patterns. This means that we need to use "dd", "MM",
# "yy" in the patterns that we pass to SimpleDateFormat, while we want
# to display date patterns in a localised form.
#
# So, the pattern attributes declared here are for SimpleDateFormat,
# while the display attributes are the date patterns that get presented
# to the user.

GroundRules = [ko]In order for Scarab to truly be effective (and to keep people like {0} from being constantly in your hair), here are the ground rules...
GroundRules1 = [ko]1) When you see an issue come through email channels, this is an indication that you have either been assigned or cc'd on a particular issue.  Don't ignore it!
GroundRules2 = [ko]2) If you are the assignee and have the bandwith, it is your responsibility to investigate the issue and if it has been given a milestone "fix" the issue in the proper order.
GroundRules3 = [ko]3) If you are the assignee and don't have the bandwidth, it is your responsibility to communicate (through the description field) your inability to complete the assignment.
GroundRules4 = [ko]4) Don't just go and fix issues that have not been given a milestone.  It is extremely important that we've carefully considered the impact your changes have on the codebase.
GroundRules5 = [ko]5) Proceed through your issues in order sorted by milestone then priority. If it makes sense to modify the sequence that's fine, just don't blow the milestone!
GroundRules6 = [ko]6) When an issue is completed (you've written the code, etc.) if applicable check it into cvs and mark the issue "fixed" with a comment on how you did it.  Fixed=[ko]=[ko]Checked In!
GroundRules7 = [ko]7) Try not to batch up a bunch of issue fixes and check them in all at once. This reeks havoc on our ability to track status and prohibits granular roll backs, etc.
GroundRules8 = [ko]8) Feel free to add more issues to the list as you realize them.  Scarab MUST reflect all of your changes for our release notes to worth anything.
GroundRules9 = [ko]9) Post any and all comments/notes around a particular issue to its description field. This way anyone who is handed an issue can easily see its history and get crackin!
GroundRules10 = [ko]10) Refer to Scarab on an almost constant basis.  In practice you'll find that seeing what is expected of you here beats the hell out of sifting through emails.
GroundRulesEnd = [ko]At first this may seem Draconian.  The truth is that this is simply a way for us to track our own to do lists, share our to do's with friends, and keep pesky status mongers out of our hair.  I truly look forward to the day when I come a knockin' and you reply "its in Scarab!"

##Introduction
ScarabIs = Scarab is
IntroP1 = a highly configurable issue tracking tool that can be used for all types of projects: technical and non-technical alike. Because all parameters in the system are configurable, this tool meets the needs of the project as well as the individual user. Each implementation can be configured directly to the workflow processes of the project through the definition of issue types and attributes. The user interface is designed to be accessible and constant: once you become familiar with the look and feel you will find new processes quick to master.
ScarabProvides = Scarab provides
IntroP2 = a robust set of tools for issue management:
IntroP3Head = Issue entry: 
IntroP3 = The issue entry process  is designed to help users create meaningful issues and avoid duplication.   Attributes are used to describe issues and to check the issue database for   similar entries. If any duplicates are found, the user has the opportunity   to review potential duplicates, add comments to like issues or modify their   issue before committing it to the database. 
IntroP4Head = Templates for issue entry :
IntroP4 = Frequently entered issue criteria can be saved in templates for speedy entry. Files can be attached to an issue, and are tracked directly with their issue. Users can add and edit comments to issues as needed. Users can access and review the complete issue history while viewing an issue. 
IntroP5Head = Issue query:
IntroP5 = Accessing issues in the database is simple using the query feature. Users can easily find, access and modify issues individually or in groups. The Advanced Query feature allows the user to create detailed issue searches, specifying values for multiple attributes and limiting their search to specific date or issue number ranges. The Custom Query feature allows the user to search by text string-the user can specify a set of information to compare against issues in the database. Frequently used queries can be saved and easily run. <!--Once a saved query has been created, the user can request frequent email updates on issues matching the search criteria.-->
IntroP6Head = Reports: 
IntroP6 = The robust reports interface allows the user to create and save reports. Reports provide customizable and meaningful metrics.
IntroP7Head = Email notifications: 
IntroP7 = As important events occur, email is generated and sent to all parties associated with the event. Alert emails contain links to views of the event.
IntroP8 = While Scarab is designed to be an easy to use, intuitive application, should you need additional assistance this help system has been provided. In the help system you will find definitions of Scarab terminology and navigation aid as well as hints for using the application.

## Navigation
EntryForms = Entry forms
ResultsandSelection = Results and selection pages
CustomizingInterface = Customizing the interface
TheScarab = The Scarab 
NavP1 = interface is organized to allow access to all major functionality from anywhere in the application. Each of the action screens provides relevant information along with links to access further details as needed. A unified and consistent interface allows you to easily recognize the types of information and actions available on each screen. 
NavP2 = Each screen provides the following navigational aids
NavP3Head = The Left navigation bar:
NavP3 = The navigation bar is organized by issue type, then by function. To access functionality within a specific issue type, select the title of the issue type on the left navigation bar. The functionality available to that issue type will appear below the title. 
NavP4Head = The Query bar
NavP4 = The query   bar provides access to the search tools. Th issue id box allows you   to access a specific issue number. The select query box provides access   to the Advanced and Custom query features. If you have any saved queries,   they will appear in the select query box.
NavP5Head = Section titles
NavP5 = Most information screens are organized in tabular format. Each section is presented with an informative section header, describing the section and, often, providing general information about the section. Each column header acts as a link to change the sort order for that table. For the sort column, the title has an arrow indicating the direction of the sort: the default is ascending. To change the direction of the sort click on the arrow.
Buttons = Buttons:
Buttons1 = Buttons
NavP6 = indicate a set of actions that can be performed. Often you will find more than one set of buttons on a page. Buttons directly below a section will perform actions on the section only, if you have you may find an 
NavP6S2 = Update Options
NavP6S3 = button beside an attribute selector in one section. This indicates that if you change the attribute clicking the button will change the options available to that attribute. 
NavP7Head = Checkboxes:
NavP7 = used to select list items for modification.
NavP8 = In many cases, helpful information is included directly on the screens to clarify unusual operations. Error messages are provided in line to help identify where the error occurred and specific means for remedy.
NavP9Head = Entry forms
NavP9 = Entry forms are easy to use. Default data points are indicated with * (astricks) beside the field title. Often you will find textual guidelines within the entry forms to help you through the form entry process.
NavP10 = Navigational buttons are available on each screen. These buttons perform actions on the data entered in the form. The 
CancelDesc = cancels the process in which you currently are engaged.
ContinueDesc = button will take you to the next part of the entry process.
DoneDesc = button will save your work and return you to the last process in which you were engaged.
NextDesc = button indicates that there is further information to be gathered on the next screen. Clicking this button will cache your current data and take you to the next part in the wizard.
NavP10Head = Tabs      
NavP10S1 = Some multipart functionality provides tabs for easy navigation between parts. In the reports functionality you can use the tabs to switch from defining row content to the final output characteristics.
NavP11 = If you have a saved data set for an entry form (like saved queries or reports, or issue entry templates), the top section contains a drop down list with all such items available for use on this form. This appears in the issue entry, query and reports functionality. To use a saved form select the one of interest from the drop down box and use the 
Selectlc = select
NavP11S2 = button to render the selection.
NavP12 = Each attribute in an entry form displays all available options, from which you can select one or more. 
NavP13Head = Results and selection pages
NavP13 = Results screens appear after you have activated a request, like a query, a report, etc. Each results screen provides a list of items with some descriptive information.
NavP14 = Many results screens allow you to perform actions on the items that appear. Under the items you will find a set of buttons linked to actions that can be performed. There may be two sets of buttons. The first set will affect only those items you select using the checkboxes. If a second set appears, they will perform actions on all items in the list.
NavP15 = Below the action buttons you may find links to additional actions. These links allow you to affect the layout of results.
NavP16Head = Sort order  
NavP16 = Items are initially in ascending order by their id. To sort by an attribute, click the title of the attribute. The sort will change to ascending by that attribute. Clicking the arrow beside the attribute name will provide a descending sort. 
NavP17 = Many screens are customizable. You can add to or remove the attributes that appear on your screen by clicking on the add/remove attributes from view link. Use the check boxes to show or hide attributes. Add a check to the items you would like to appear on your screen. Use this screen to determine the order of the columns by using the "Columnar sequence" field.

## ScarabBestPractices
ScarabGuidelines = Scarab guidelines
ProjectKnowledge = Project knowledge sharing
TrackingProject = Tracking project health
BestP1 = The success of any project depends on managing and solving problems. How you use the tools will be dependent upon how your project is organized and your planned workflow processes. You can use the tools as a knowledge sharing device and a means of tracking and managing the health of your project.
BestP2 = Information captured within Scarab can be highly effective for many areas within a project. Because Scarab is so highly configurable, knowledge resources can be customized to the needs of each discipline within an organization. Tracking a feature across discipline lines can be done by copying issues and creating dependencies between them.For instance, Project Go has issue typesorganized by milestone within the feature lifecycle. Project Go has the following issue types: Planning, Development, Testing, Release management andSupport. New features are entered in the Planning issue type where they are processed till ready for development. At that point, the issueis copied to Development, Release management and Testing issue types and all copies are set to blocked by the Development issue. All actors have a full description of the feature, includingall conversations involved in creating the specifications. Since all issues have interdependencies, monitoring efforts across the discipline lines isan easy process. Blocking all the issues by the Development issue means that none of them can be closed till the development cycle has completed,but each group can continue to work based on what is happening with the development project. For example, documentation may be a part of the release managementcycle. Writers can track the features in development and track their documentation efforts in their own issue with links to the development issue. After thefeature has been released to the users, support can track in coming issues and easily access information about the feature through any of the issue types and be able to link to other areas quickly through the issue history. 
BestP3 = Scarab can assist in tracking and assessing the health of a project. If your project is experiencing a particular type of concern you need to track, Scarab can help you do this through a series of processes. For example, Project Go has just added a new database and developers are concerned that the new database will cause significant performance problems. While running routine reports and queries, the project lead has determined that there is, indeed, a performance issue possibly associated with the new database. It is determined that fixing this problem is top priority and critical to the success of the project. To facilitate work on this problem, the project owner has created an issue entry template and series of queries and reports. Users are asked to use the template and enter specific information about what they have found in a description attribute. The template is used to regularize information about issues. Using a saved query, project members can quickly access issues involving this concern and concentrate efforts in critical areas. Tracking the progress of resolving the performance problems can be done using reports. How to configure it for your needs can be confusing. This document is a suggested set of practices.


## ScarabFAQ
FrequentlyAskedQuestions = Frequently asked questions
WhatIssueType = How do I figure out what issue type to use?
WhatIssueTypeAnswer = The issue types available to you in your project have been determined by your project administrator. By accessing the 
WhatIssueTypeAnswer2 = Issue Type selection
WhatIssueTypeAnswer3 = screen you can see a description of each issue type and select the one that best describes your issue. For more information see the 
WhatIssueTypeAnswer4 = discussion.
CanIMoveIssues = Can I move an issue to a different issue type? how about to a different project? 
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer = Issues can be moved between issue types through the issue detail page. For more information see the
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer2 = moving issues
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer3 = discussion. For a discussion on circumstances in which you may wish to move issues, see the 
CanIMoveIssuesAnswer4 = document.
StopDuplicateChecking = How can stop the duplication checking?
StopDuplicateCheckingAnswer = The duplication checking process is set by the project leader. If you feel it is affecting the processing of issues, contact your project administrator.
CanIAddAttributes = How do I add or remove attributes from my screen?
CanIAddAttributesAnswer = Many pages in Scarab are customizable. For more information see the discussion on 
CustomizingTheScreen = customizing the screen.
GlobalAndUserAttributes = What is the difference between a Global attribute and a User attribute?
GlobalAndUserAttributesAnswer = Global attributes are used to define issues. Global attributes are defined at the domain level and made available within issue types by the Project Owner. When creating issues, the values assigned to global attributes become the descriptors for issues. Values associated with global attributes and used to search the database for issues when using queries. You may find Global attributes like "Status", "Description", "Operating System" and the like in your Issue Type.
GlobalAndUserAttributesAnswer2 = Once issues are created, User attributes are used to associate users with issues. User attributes are defined at the global level and are associated with a base permission and an email action. Users with the right permission appear in the User attributes drop down menu and can be associted with an issue using that User attribute. The Assigned To attribute is a User attribute.
GlobalAndUserAttributesAnswer3 = For more information on Global attributes see

Overview = Overview
EnteringIssues = Entering Issues
Composing = Composing effective issues
EnteringAnIssues = Entering an issue
SettingDependecies = Setting dependencies
IssueAttachments = Issue attachments
HandlingDuplicates = Handling duplicates
ReviewDuplicates = Reviewing duplicates
CommentingOn = Commenting on like issues
BypassDuplicates = [ko]Bypass duplicates
UsingTemplates = Using templates
IssueEntryP1 = Effective issue reports assist in the process of refining projects and reaching the ultimate goal of completion. A useful issue report normally has two qualities:
IssueEntryP2Head = Reproducible.
IssueEntryP2 = Issues that cannot be duplicated are generally   marked invalid. Provide detailed instructions for duplicating your issue.
IssueEntryP3Head = Specific
IssueEntryP3 = The more details you provide the easier it   is for the engineer to identify the problem and solution.     
IssueEntryP4 = For example: you're testing a web browser. You crash at site.com, and want to write up an issue report:
IssueEntryP5 = Inappropriate:
IssueEntryP6 = "My browser crashed. I think I was on site.com. My computer uses Windows. I think that this is a really bad problem and you should fix it now. By the way, I don't like the icons. Nobody will use your software if you keep those ugly icons. Oh, and my grandmother's home page doesn't look right, either, it's all messed up. Good luck." 
IssueEntryP7 = More appropriate:
IssueEntryP8 = "I crashed each time when I went to site.com, using the 10.28.99 build on a Win NT 4.0 (Service Pack 5) system. I also rebooted into Linux, and reproduced this problem using the 10.28.99 Linux build.
IssueEntryP9 = It again crashed each time upon drawing the banner at the top of the page. I broke apart the page, and discovered that the following image link will crash the application reproducibly, unless you remove the "border=0" attribute:
IssueEntryP10 = <IMG SRC="http://site.com/images/topics/topicfoos.gif" width=34 height=44 border=0 alt="News">
IssueEntryP11Head = Entering an issue
IssueEntryP11 = Because of it's highly customizable nature, entering issues in Scarab can be as individual as the person entering the issue. There are some basic principles that apply to all issues being entered in the database: for each issue entered you will define the issue and add supporting information. You may also be able to check the database for duplicates.
IssueEntryP12Head = Defining issues
IssueEntryP12 = Each issue type has a unique set of attributes specific to the needs of the issue type. When entering the issue you will want to add values for as many attributes as possible. Remember, when creating effective issues you want to be as specific and detailed as possible. Attributes allow you to add meaningful information that can be easily used for tracking and searching purposes.
IssueEntryP13 = While creating the issue, use the textual fields to add as much specific information for the issue. Your administrator may have defined attributes to track specific generic information, but the more details you can add into the text fields the better issue you will have created.
IssueEntryP14Head = Adding supporting information
IssueEntryP14 = In the issue entry process you can add additional relevant information; you can include dependencies on other issues as well as attaching appropriate files (like patches, emails, etc.).
IssueEntryP15Head = Setting dependencies: 
IssueEntryP15 = Issues often have dependencies on other issues. One issue may require a resolution from another before any work can be done. Two issues may have parallel resolutions and need to be tracked together, though they have no direct influence on one another
IssueEntryP16 = There are three levels of dependencies within Scarab: blocking, duplicating and non-blocking. Blocking issues prevent the issue being blocked, from being resolved. The blocking issue must be addressed before the blocked issue can be resolved.
IssueEntryP17 = Sometimes duplicate issues may be entered and need to be tracked separately. Marking an issue as a duplicate allows users to track efforts on both issues. Duplicates may be in different modules or the same module.
IssueEntryP18 = Marking issues as non-blocking dependencies also allows users to simultaneously track efforts on two or more issues.
IssueEntryP19 = You can track the progress of interrelated issues by using the Dependencies section of the issue and clicking on either the issue id or the Issue summary links to the issues. In this area you can also redefine the Dependency type.
IssueEntryP20Head = Issue attachments:
IssueEntryP20S1 = Keeping track of information relating to an issue is simplified using the issue attachment feature. You can include email conversations, relevant documentation, patch files, or any other supporting file. If you need to include a url, you can add that into any text field. To add a file, use the
IssueEntryP20S2 = section in the 
IssueEntryP20S3 = form (if you have duplication active, this will appear after the duplication checking process). To do so, enter a brief description of the attachment and use the browse button to navigate to the file on your local system or enter a path for the file and click the 
IssueEntryP20S4 = button. You can repeat this process to add multiple files.
IssueEntryP21Head = Handling Duplicates
IssueEntryP22 = If you have duplication checking active, Scarab will use a subset of attributesIssueEntryto check for possible duplicates in the database. If duplicates are found IssueEntrya report of similar issues will be presented with your issue listed at the top. Review the issues listed for fit. You can do a number of things at thisIssueEntrypoint:
IssueEntryP23 = Review individual issues by clicking on their id. The full issue descriptionIssueEntry  will appear. 
IssueEntryP24 = Sort issues by each of the categories. Click on the name of the category to change the sort order
IssueEntryP25 = Alter one or more issues at the same time. Click on the check box to the left of the issue ids that you would like to manipulate. You can then enter a note in the
IssueEntryP25S2 = field and click the 
IssueEntryP25S3 = button to add a note to the comments section of all issues selected.
IssueEntryP26 = Skip this process by clicking on the 
IssueEntryP26S2 = button.
IssueEntryP27Head = Reviewing duplicates
IssueEntryP27 = For each item in the database that has been identified as a possible duplicate for the criteria you entered, an entry appears in the 
IssueEntryP27S2 = Identified as duplicate
IssueEntryP27S3 = screen. You can change the sort order by clicking on the title of the column. Each column represents an attribute used in the search for duplicates. 
IssueEntryP28 = Each module has a set of assigned attributes. The values entered for each of the attributes is parsed into a search string so that each value becomes a searchable string. Use this page to compare your potential new issue with those in the database. 
IssueEntryP29Head = Commenting on like issues
IssueEntryP29 = The note box under the list of like issues allows you to add comments to issues without going to the issue. You may want to comment that you are experiencing similar problems, recommend a solution for a similar issue or add to the information in an attribute. Information entered in the
IssueEntryP29S2 = box will be added to the 
IssueEntryP29S3 = section in the issue. To add comments, enter text in the
IssueEntryP29S4 = box and click the
IssueEntryP29S5 = button. Once your entry has been processed a message will appear at the top of the screen letting you know that hat your comment has been added.

## UserIssueModify
ManagingInformation = Managing information
AssociatingUsers = Associating users
MovingIssues = Moving issues
ModifyP1 = Once an issue has been created it is ready for assignment or manipulation. You can perform the following functions on issues in the database:
ModifyP2 = review, add or edit information about the issue
ModifyP3 = associate users 
ModifyP4 = move issues
ManagingIssueInfo = Managing issue information
ManagingIssueInfoP1 = Almost all attributes of an issue are editable from the view issue screen. You can alter most attribues, if you have the proper permission level, view user associations, add url links, create dependencies, add attachments, and view the issue history.
DependenciesP1 = You can alter or add dependencies as necessary. As when creating an issue, you must define the dependency type. Dependencies can be blocking, non-blocking or duplicating. For more information on dependencies see
AssociatingUsersP1 = The administrator may have defined several types of user attributes that allow users to easily track the issues they are responsible for or in which they have an interest. You can also use user attributes to search for specfic issues.
AssociatingUsersP2 = All user association tasks are performed on the 
AssociatingUsersP2S1 = screen. To access this screen either use the 
AssociatingUsersP2S2 = button on the view issue page or search for a group of issues and use the 
AssociatingUsersP2S3 = button. On the Assign screen you will see a list of users currently associated with the issue, their email adress and the type of association and a User section which allows you to add users to the issue. You can filter the list of users using the filter form. You can search for users by First name, Last name or email address.
AssociatingUsersP3Head = associating a user:
AssociatingUsersP3 = Once you have narrowed the list of users to select from you can select an association type for the drop down box next to the users name. Use the check box to add multiple users at the same time. Once you have selected your users and set their association type use the 
AssociatingUsersP4Head = removing an associated user:
AssociatingUsersP4 = select the user or users you would like to remove from the issue and click the 
AssociatingUsersP5Head = altering the association type:
AssociatingUsersP5 = If you need to change the type of association use the association type drop down box next to the name of the user. Each association type available for that user will be listed in that box.
AssociatingUsersP6 = User attributes can also be used in a search criteria.If you do not see a specific user on the user list contact your administrator and make sure that they have been added to the user attribute.
MovingIssuesP1 = You may need to track a similar issue in multiple areas. Rather than entering the same issue twice, in different areas, you can copy an issue 
ToAnotherModule = to another module.
MovingIssuesP1S2 = Use the Copy/move functionality. Select copy. You will be presented with an attribute mapping functionality. You will be able to track where each attribute
MovingIssuesP1S3 = issues in the destination module.
MovingIssuesP1S4 = You will be presented with an attribute mapping functionality to reconcile any attributes that have values in the source issue but do not exist in the destination module or issue type. Selecting the checkbox next to the attribute will copy or move the attribute into a comment.
InOriginalModule = in the original module.
MovingIssuesP2 = To move or copy multiple issues at once, you must first conduct a query that will return the issues you wish to move or copy. See 
MovingIssuesP2S2 = for help on building queries. You can move/copy all of the resulting issues or select a subset to be moved or copied. To move or copy all resulting issues, select
MovingIssuesP2S3 = from the
MovingIssuesP2S4 = dropdown box. To move or copy a subset of the resulting issues, select the issues you wish to copy or move by clicking on the checkbox next to each issue and select
MovingIssuesP2S5 = dropdown box.
MovingIssuesP3 = Next, you must select the destination. The
MovingIssuesP3S2 = table includes a list of available modules each with a dropdown box containing all available issue types. Select the desired issue type for the module to which you wish to move or copy the selected issues and click the

Relationships = Relationships: 
RelationshipsDef = Scarab can track relationships between issues. Dependencies between issues can be flagged and tracked through either the issue entry process or while reviewing one or multiple issues. 
ChangeTracking = Change tracking:
ChangeTrackingDef = All changes made along with information about the user who made the change, when the change was made and any comments committed along with the change are tracked with the issue. 
CommentViewing = Comment viewing and editing:
CommentViewingDef = All comments made to the issue are tracked. Comments allow support or other type conversations to be viewable and editable by any parties interested in the progress of an issue. 
SaveFrequentInfo = Save frequently entered information: 
SaveFrequentInfoDef = The issue entry template feature allows you to create a frequently used set of data points for attributes in a template. When a template is used, the issue entry form is pre-populated and the user can alter information as needed. 
IssueTypesP1 = Issue types provide a unique set of attributes and options used to describe issues in a meaningful manner. Attributes within an issue type are defined by the project administrator and affect only issues within that issue type. Each project has a unique set of issue types. You may have a different set of permissions for each issue type in your project. Issues remain within the issue type in which they are entered until a user moves or copies them to another issue type.
IssueTypesP2 = Before you enter issues for your project, you should familiarize yourself with the available set of issue types. Where you enter an issue will be determined by how your project is organized. Once you have selected the issue type that best describes your issue, click on the name of the issue.
IssueAttributesP1 = Attributes are the common descriptors for issues. Attributes are used to categorize issues for tracking, comparative and rate of change analysis. Each issue type has a unique set of attributes like Summary, Description, Milestone, Priority, Status, Resolution and Severity. There is a default set of values for the attributes but your project administrator may have altered the set available for your issue type.
IssueAttributesP2 = Attributes can be organized in groups. If duplication checking is active, you enter a subset of attributes for the issue. This subset is used to check for duplicates in the database. After the duplication checking process is complete, you can enter values for the remaining attributes. 
IssueAttributesP3 = An issue type may have a set of required attributes. Values for the required attributes must be entered before committing the issue. Required attributes are identified by an asterisks (*) beside the name of the attribute.
IssueAttributesP4 = On many results pages you can change which attributes appear on your screen. For information on customizing your interface see
IssueEntryScreenP1 = After selecting your issue type and the Enter new link from the left navigation. At this point you can enter values for the available attributes. Each attribute will have either a drop down box with options to select from or a text entry form for you to enter text. All attributes with an asterisks (*) beside the title must have values before saving the issue.

IssueEntryScreenP2 = If duplication tracking is active, entering an issue becomes a three step process. The first step is to define a subset of attributes that will be used to check for duplicates in the database once you have used the 
IssueEntryScreenP2S2 = button. The second step is to review all possible duplicates and determine what action to perform (see Duplicates for more information on duplicate management). The third step is to enter values for the remaining attributes.
IssueEntryScreenP3 = While you are entering the issue you can attach a relevant file using the  same form. Attaching a file helps you and others to easily share relevant information or patches. For more information on adding attachments see 
IssueEntryScreenP5 = Before submitting your issue you can select where in the application you would like to go next. Each option submits the issue and takes you to one of the following functional areas:
AssignIssue = Assign issue
ViewThisIssue = View this issue
StartPage = Start page
ReturnToHome = Return to home
AfterSubmit = After submit
IssueReadOnly = This issue is read-only because its issue type has been marked as no longer active.
XMLImportExportP1 = You can use the XML Import/Export feature to migrate your existing issue database into a new Scarab database. You can also use this feature to synchronize your older or external tracking component database with the Scarab database. This allows you to continue using the older tracking component until your module's members are comfortable with Scarab. Once the import is completed, you can treat the imported issues just like any other Scarab issue.
ExportingIssues = Exporting issues
ExportingIssuesP1 = This feature exports issues as XML which you can either view in the browser window or save as a downloadable file. You can use the exported file  for a variety of  purposes, such as archiving issues or synchronizing other tracking databases with the Scarab database. Issues may be exported from the current module only. You must have the Project Issue Tracking - Query permission to use the XML export issues feature.
ExportingIssuesP2 = You can export issues singly or in batches. When exporting batches of issues, you can include issues by including their IDs in a comma-separated list or a range of IDs. Specifying a comma-separated list exports only the issues specified in the list. For example, 10, 20, 30, 50 will export only issues 10, 20, 30 and 50. Specifying a range of issue IDs exports all issues in the range.  For example, 1-50 will export all issues with IDs from 1 to 50. You can specify issues to export using a combination of comma-separated list and ranges.  For example: 1-5, 10, 20 will export issues 1 through 5 and issues 10 and 20.
ExportingIssuesP3 = To XML export issues:
ExportingIssuesP3B1 = link on the navigation bar.
ExportingIssuesP3B2 = Enter the issue IDs to be exported in the <strong>Issues</strong> field.
ExportingIssuesP3B3 = Select your export destination by clicking the appropriate radio button in the <strong>Options</strong> field.
ImportingIssues = Importing issues
ImportingIssuesP1 = This feature imports issue data  from  XML files. The imported issues are  treated as  new issues in the Scarab database. You must have the Project Issue Tracking - Submit permission to use the XML import issues feature.
ImportingIssuesP2 = Scarab accepts only those XML files that follow the Scarab DTD. The  following elements in the &quot;module&quot; section of the XML file  must match the settings for the current module:
ImportingIssuesP2B1 = this is the domain in which your module exists. If the URL for your module is module.domain.com, the domain element in the XML file should look like <code>&lt;domain&gt;domain.com&lt;/domain&gt;</code>.
ImportingIssuesP2B2 = this is the module name. If the URL for your module is module.domain.com, the name element should look like <code>&lt;name&gt;module&lt;/name&gt;</code>.
ImportingIssuesP2B3 = this is the Issue code for your module. If the issue code for your module is set to SC, the code element should look like <code>&lt;code&gt;SC&lt;/code&gt;</code>.
ImportingIssuesP3 = The module to which you are importing must contain all of the  usernames, issue  types, attributes, and  attribute options referenced in the XML file. On a successful import, Scarab creates a new issue for each issue in the XML file and  assigns an issue ID to each. You can then treat these new issues as you would any other issue in the database.
ImportingIssuesP4 = To XML import issues:
ImportingIssuesP4B1 = Browse and select the file or enter the file name to import.
Button = button

## UserReports
ReportsOverview = Reports: overview
ReportContent = Row and column content
GeneratingReports = Generating and saving reports
ReportsP1 = Reports allow you to track the progress of your project. You can easily define, save and run reports in an issue type. Defining and using reports is a simple process:
ReportsP2 = Define your type of report
ReportsP3 = Determine your attribute filters
ReportsP4 = Select the row and column content
ReportsP5 = There are two types of reports available within Scarab: comparative analysis and rate of change.
ReportsP6 = The Scarab report build consists of three tabs:  
ReportsP7 = The final step in defining a report is to set the display options. Use this area to define the row and column content.
ReportsP8 = Selecting issue types
ReportsP9 = The issue type included in the report defaults to the currently selected issue type. If you wish to define a report for a different or multiple issue types/modules, click the <strong>Edit list</strong> button. This will take you to the <strong>Cross module/issue type list</strong> page. You can use this page to define a list of issues types within the current module or across multiple modules to be included in your report.  It is highly recommended that the issue types for the report be chosen prior to working with the  content tabs.  Though it is possible to modify the list later, additions that conflict with already entered data on the other tabs will not be allowed.
ReportsP10 = On the <strong>Cross module/issue type list</strong> page, you can perform the following tasks:
ReportsP11 = Select a previously saved cross module list to use.
ReportsP12 = Remove issue types from your report by checking the checkbook next to any issue type in the top section of the page and clicking the <strong>Remove selected</strong> button. To remove all issue types, click the <strong>Remove all</strong> button.
ReportsP13 = Add issue types to your report by checking the checkbox next to any issue type in the top section of the page and clicking the <strong>Add selected</strong> button.
ReportsP14 = When you have selected the desired group of issue types for your report, you can save the list for future use by clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button.
ReportsP15 = Click the <strong>Done</strong> button to return to the <strong>Report information</strong> page where the selected issue types will appear in the <strong>Artifact types selected for this report</strong> section.
ReportsP16 = Entering Summary information
ReportsP17 = The <strong>Summary</strong> section of the <strong>Report information</strong> tab allows you to enter information for saving your report. This information is optional and can be added at any point report creation process.  You can provide the following information:
ReportsP18 = Enter a name for your report in the <strong>Name</strong> field.
ReportsP19 = Enter a description in the <strong>Report description</strong> field.
ReportsP20 = Select the report <strong>Availability</strong>. If you have permissions that allow you to make your reports available to other module members, the Availability field will appear allowing you to choose whether to save the report for personal use or for module use.
ReportsP21 = Select the format for the report. The available formats are Web, Excel (.xls), and Tab separated (.txt). 
ReportsP22 = When you have entered all of the desired information, click the <strong>Update</strong> button to add this information to your report.
ReportsP23 = The <strong>Row content</strong> and <strong>Column content</strong> tabs allow you to define and organize the data included in your report. These tabs contain identical information and options; however, you can select different data types on each tab. This allows you to create unique, in depth reports. Once both the row and column content have been defined, you can generate the report.
ReportsP24 = Data types
ReportsP25 = The <strong>Row/Column criteria</strong> section allows you to select the type of data presented in the rows or columns of your report. The available selections are:
ReportsP26 = When this data type is selected, you can choose from among the attributes and options defined for the selected issue types.
ReportsP27 = When this data type is selected, you can choose from among the module members and specify a user attribute for each user selected.
ReportsP28 = When this data type is selected, you can define dates for each row or column of your report.
ReportsP29 = The option selected in the <strong>Select content type</strong> field determines the data available in the rest of the sections of these tabs. Only one content type can be used for each heading. If you choose Date(s) as a content type on either the <strong>Row content</strong> or <strong>Column content</strong> tab, it must be  the only heading on that axis. However, you can  define user criteria for one or more heading levels and option attributes for other headings on the same axis. Changing the content type to Date(s) after defining a set of user or attribute/option criteria for either the row or column content tabs will discard the previously entered data for that tab.
ReportsP30 = Sorting  attribute options and user attributes into headings and groups
ReportsP31 = When generating reports containing attribute options and user attributes, the organization of the data can mean the difference between a useful analysis tool and an unreadable mass of numbers. To help you organize your data, Scarab allows you to arrange report data into headings which are combined in the final report to allow multiple criteria per cell.
ReportsP32 = Headings are defined solely by the data  they contain. To create headings within your report:
ReportsP33 = In the <strong>Report builder</strong>, click on either the <strong>Row content </strong>tab or the <strong>Column content</strong> tab.
ReportsP34 = Select the content type for this heading in the  <strong>Select content type</strong> drop down box.
ReportsP35 = Select the  options you wish to include in the first heading of your report.
ReportsP36 = Click the <strong>Update</strong> button.
ReportsP37 = If you wish to include more than one heading in your report, in the <strong>axis content: Row/Column headings section</strong>, click the <strong>Add another heading</strong> button.
ReportsP38 = Select the content type for this heading in the <strong>Select content type</strong> drop down box. If the previously defined heading contains user attributes or attributes/options, you cannot select the Date(s) content types. Doing so will discard the previously entered heading.
ReportsP39 = Select the  options you wish to include in this heading.
ReportsP40 = When finished, click the <strong>Update</strong> button.
ReportsP41 = Continue adding headings and selecting options in this manner until all the options you wish to see in your report have been included.
ReportsP42 = You can edit a previously defined heading by clicking on the radio button next to the heading and clicking the <strong>Edit selected heading</strong> button. You can delete previously defined heading by clicking on the radio button next to the heading and clicking the <strong>Remove selected heading</strong> button. 
ReportsP43 = Scarab allows you to further organize reports data by grouping the attributes and options within your  headings.  For example, if options P1, P2, P3, and P4 for the Priority attribute have all been selected, you could group P1 and P2 as "high priority" and P3 and P4 as "low priority".
ReportsP44 = You must have defined at least one heading containing <strong>Attribute/option(s)</strong> in your report before you can define groups.  To group options within headings:
ReportsP45 = On the <strong>Row content</strong> tab or the <strong>Column content</strong> tab, select a heading containing the <strong>Attribute/option(s)</strong> content type and click the <strong>Edit selected heading</strong> button.
ReportsP46 = In the group related data section, enter a name for the group and click the <strong>Add new</strong> button. Repeat this step if you wish to have additional groups within this heading.
ReportsP47 = In the <strong>Grouping report data-set attributes/options</strong> section, select the group you want each option to appear in from the <strong>Group name</strong> drop down box next to each attribute/option.
ReportsP48 = When done, click the <strong>Update</strong> button.
ReportsP49 = Selecting users and attributes
ReportsP50 = Reporting on user attributes allows you to determine how the workload in your module is  distributed. You can use the <strong>Users (by attribute)</strong> data type to create reports thatindicate how issues are assigned or otherwise associated with users.</p>
ReportsP51 = To define  <strong>Users (by attribute)</strong> reporting criteria:
ReportsP52 = On either the <strong>Row content</strong> or <strong>Column content</strong> tab, select <strong>User (by attribute)</strong> from the <strong>Select content type</strong> drop down box.
ReportsP53 = In the Users table, select the checkbox in the Select column and the desired user attribute in the drop down box in the Association column of the user you wish to include.
ReportsP54 = Click the <strong>Add selected to assignee list</strong> button.
ReportsP55 = To include multiple user attributes for a single user, you must add the user again with the additional attribute selected. For instance, if you wanted to generate a report to indicate which users have ownership and quality assurance responsibility for the  issues in your module, you would need to select each user twice--first with the <strong>Assigned to</strong> user attribute, then with the <strong>QA contact</strong> user attribute.
ReportsP56 = Reporting by dates
ReportsP57 = To help you determine how your module is progressing, Scarab allows you generate reports based on  dates/times. Date/time reports provide a snapshot of issue activity at a single point in time. You can design reports to include several date/times to show the progress over a specific period of time.
ReportsP58 = To create  date/time reports:
ReportsP59 = On either the <strong>Row content</strong> or <strong>Column content</strong> tab, Select <strong>Date(s) </strong>from the <strong>Select content type</strong> drop down box.
ReportsP60 = In the <strong>Select row/column (dates) content</strong> table, use the drop down boxes to select the date and time you want to include in your report.
ReportsP61 = Click the <strong>Add single date/time</strong> button.
ReportsP62 = Continue adding dates in this fashion until all desired dates are included.
ReportsP63 = You can include future dates in your report. A row or column with a future date will appear blank in the generated report; however, the row or column will populate when the report is regenerated after the date has passed. This can be used to create progress reports which are generated repeatedly. By adding dates well into the future and saving the report, you can minimize the amount of time spent defining frequently generated reports.
ReportsP64 = Once you have defined both row and column content, the <strong>Generate report</strong> button will appear. Clicking this button will create the report in the format you have selected on the <strong>Report information</strong> tab. 
ReportsP65 = When viewing the report in the Web format, you can perform the following tasks:
ReportsP66 = Rotate the  report by clicking the <strong>swap row and column </strong> link.
ReportsP67 = Save the report by clicking the <strong>Save this report</strong> button. If you have not entered summary information on the <strong>Report information </strong>tab, you will be returned to that tab. You must enter a name for the report and click the <strong>Update</strong> button to  add the summary information to the report. Click the <strong>Save this report</strong> button again to save.
ReportsP68 = Export the report to Excel or tab separated values by selecting the desired export format from the <strong>Export results to:</strong> drop down box.


## UserQuerySaved
AdvancedQueries = Advanced queries
CustomQueries = Custom queries
TextQueries = Text queries
SearchingOverview = Overview
SavingQueries = Saving queries
ManagingQueries = Managing saved queries
SubscribingQueries = Subscribing to saved queries
UQSP1 = Once you have a well defined set of search parameters you may want to save them for future use. Saved queries can be used to generate reminders, keep you informed of progress on issues or to quickly access a specific issue configuration. You may have access to globally available saved queries or create your own.
UQSP2S1 = To create a saved query access the page and 
UQSP2S2 = define your search parameters (for more information see Advanced). Click the 
SaveThisQuery = Save this query 
UQSP2S3 = button. Stored queries are accessible through the 
UQSP2S4 = link on the left navigation bar or in the drop down box on the query bar. The saved query drop box only appears if you have stored queries.
The = The
UQSP3 = screen is where you can give your saved querya unique identification. Your query name should be short and descriptive. The Saved query name appears in the Query bar. You can add a description to further identify your query. The query description appears in the saved query list screen and can help users make a better determination of which query to use.
UQSP4 = For example, you have defined several queries that search for issues that relate to the AIX operating system. One of your queries specifically look for all new high priority issues entered. A second query may search for all closed high priority issues. The first query is named AIXopen, the second AIXclosed. You can use the description field to remind yourself that these issues are specifically for high priority issues.
UQSP5 = Before you can save your query you need to determine the availability. Your query can be available only to yourself by selecting "personal" from the drop down list. If you think your query is of value to all members of the project, you can select "global." If you do not have permission to create a global saved query, the query will be submitted to the administrator for approval (see Approval for further information on the approval process).
ClickThe = Click the 
UQSP6 = button to complete the saving process.
StoredQuery = Stored query
UQSP6S1 = page is used to manage the saved queries. All queries that are available for this issue type appear in this table. Click on the name of the query to access the query edit screen. The location link will execute the query. Clicking on the name in the 
Initiatedby = Initiated by
UQSP6S2 = field will provide an email form, using your browsers default email interface. You can also set a default query and subscribe (see below for more information).
UQSP7 = Using the buttons you can affect multiple queries simultaneously. Use the check boxes to select the queries you would like affect.
Copy = Copy
UQSP8 = button will place a copy of the query. You can click the name of the copy to edit. Using this feature can help you to create fine grained saved queries. 
UQSP9 = button will remove the saved query from your list. You can delete any of your personal saved queries.
StoredQueryList = Stored query list
UQSP10S1 = Scarab can create and send regular email alerts to you regarding issues matching your saved criteria. From the 
UQSP10S2 = link on the left navigation, click the check box in the 
Subscr = Subscr
UQSP10S3 = column of your chosen query. You must also select a frequency from the 
SubscrFreq = SubscrFreq
UQSP10S4 = column. You can have reports sent to you several times a day (every half hour, hourly or twice daily), daily or weekly.
UQSP11 = Using saved queries assists the user in keeping up to date on changes to issues in the database. For instance, you may have a saved query named "my issues" that searches for all issues assigned to you with a status of "New". Subscribing to &quot;my issues&quot; saved query and setting    the frequency to twice a day will provide regular email updates to any new issues assigned to you.
UQSP12 = Subscriptions can be helpful if you have a project critical component that you need to keep a careful eye on. For instance, you are responsible for all database access issues. You know that there are some potential problems with database access for users on the Windows 95 operating system. Creating, saving and subscribing to a query with the search parameters that define your area of concern will keep alert you to issues as frequently as you need them.
DuplicateQueryName = A query by that name already exists. Please choose another name.
CannotEditQuery = You do not have permissions to edit this query.
NotifyPendingApproval = The {0} you have suggested is currently pending for approval and hence unavailable for use. You will be notified by email once the module owner takes an action on this item.
CrossModuleQueriesHavePersonalScope = Cross module queries always have personal scope

## UserQueryCustom
UQCP1 = Custom queries allow you to search the database based on a refined set of parameters. You can search on any of the text attributes as well as any other attribute your project owner has included as a quick search parameter.
UQCP2S1 = For this section, select the attributes you would like to search against. The n enter a search string. Each attribute will be searched for every term that appears in your search string. For instance, the Game project has the
SummaryDescr = Summary, Description, Story-line
and = and
ErrorMessage = Error message
UQCP3 = string attributes. You are interested in any issue that involves the usage of a joystick. You can select one, some or all of the text attributes and then enter "joystick" in the search string. Once the search is initiated, all entries in the attributes you have chosen will be searched for the term "joystick".
UQCP4 = You can use this form to determine how you would like the search results displayed. You can select what attribute you would like the results ordered by as well as the number of issues you would like to see per page.

## UserQueryAdvanced
SearchingKnowledge = Searching the knowledge base
SearchingPerson = Searching by personnel
SearchingChange = Searching by state change
UQAP1 = The advanced query form provides an interface for you to unambiguously define your search criteria. You can use this form to enter values for some, all or none of the attributes available in your issue type. You can further qualify your search criteria by requesting issues within a particular number range or date range. Say you want to know all closed issues relating to the AIX operating system within the last week. You can enter a date range (use the MM/DD/YYYY format, for instance, 01/01/2002) and define specific values for the operating system and status attributes. Clicking the 
UQAP1S2 = button will run the query.
UQAP1S3 = option from the Select query list on the query bar. Clicking the 
UQAP1S4 = button will run the query.
UQAP2 = You can define values for some, none or all of the attributes. Scarab will search the knowledge base for issues that contain all of the values you have specified. The advanced query form allows you to define fine grained search criteria. There are three types of search criteria available on the advanced query form:
SearchKnowledgeBase = Search the knowledge base

## UserQueryCrossProject
CrossProjectQueries = Cross module queries
CrossProjectP1 = Cross module queries allow you to search  multiple modules or issue types or both in a single query.  Upon accessing Scarab from the navigation bar, you can click on the <strong>Build cross module query</strong> tab. On this tab, you can either select a previously saved cross module query, or create a new one.
CrossProjectP2 = The <strong>Projects / issue in this domain</strong> table lists all issue types in all modules available to be added to your query. Projects are only available if you have permissions that allow you to query in that module. Add issue types to your query by checking the checkbox in the <strong>Select</strong> column and clicking the <strong>Add selected</strong> button. This will move the selected issue types to the <strong>Build list of issue types</strong> section. You can remove all issue types from you query by clicking the <strong>Remove all</strong> button or remove only selected issue types by clicking the <strong>Remove selected</strong> button. 
CrossProjectP3 = Once you have selected all of the issue types you want inclused in your query, you can save the list for future use by clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button. You must then complete the <strong>Name</strong> field and click the <strong>Save</strong> button again.
CrossProjectP4 = To begin you query, click the <strong>Define query</strong> button. This will take you to the <strong>Advanced query</strong> page where you can define your query criteria as you would for a single module query. For details on building queries, see Advanced query.

StateChange = State Change
UQAP3 = You can use each of these sections individually or a combination to qualify your searches. If you run a query without defining any attributes all issues associated with the logged in user id will be returned. 
UQAP4 = section provides a space for you to define values for issue attributes. Each attribute that is available to your issue type is represented here. You can define values for all, some or none of the issue attributes. You can also limit your search to a range of issues or creation dates. 
UQAP5 = Once the issue is submitted, the database will be searched for issues containing the values for all of the attributes defined in your search criteria. To effectively find the issues you are most interested in you want to define only the attributes that will meet your criteria. If you define attributes outside of your requirements you will be less likely to find any issues that meet your criteria. For instance, jdoe is looking for issues involving database errors affecting one of the UNIX operating systems. Rather than defining a value for the operating system, jdoe can create a search that will search for text strings about the database errors. If jdoe needs to refine the search criteria further, other attributes can be defined. When defining your search criteria, you should start with the smallest set of characteristics relevant to your needs.
UQAP6 = The personnel search section allows you to search for issues based on users associated. Depending on what user attributes have been defined, you can search by the commitor and/or the assignee. All users that are associated with issues in the issue can be selected from a user attribute in this section. You can select as many users as you need.
UQAP7 = This field allows you to set an attribute you would like to monitor and the original value and expected new value. For instance, you may want to know all issues that have changed from a low severity to a high severity. Additionally, you can monitor these changes within a date range. For example, you may be interested in knowing which issues have received more than 2 votes within the last week. Clicking the "Update options" button saves your changes to the query. You can also set your results view preferences at this time. You can alter the search order and the number of issues that appear per page. You can submit your query at this time or choose the save it. 

## UserQuery
QueryBar = The query bar
SearchIssue = Searching by issue id
UQP1S1 = Query functionality includes defining a very specific query, using a customized query, using saved queries and accessing specific issue ids. You can also use the 
IssueList = Issue List
UQP1S2 = to access the last query.
UQP2 = Know issue number: Enter it in "Issue ID" field.
UQP3 = Know attribute values for issue: use advanced query
UQP4 = Know approximate information about issue: use custom query
UQP5 = Already defined search parameters: use saved queries
UQP6 = For ease of use, frequently used queries can be saved. Use the left navigation link or the query bar to access saved queries. 
UQP7 = The query bar contains links to frequently used search functionality.
UQP8S1 = If you have any saved queries, a drop down box will appear first on this bar. Each of your saved queries appears in this box. You can select the saved query you need and click the 
UQP9 = form allows you to search the database for a specific issue id.
UQP10 = link allows you to specify detailed search criteria.
UQP11 = link is a text string search feature
UQP12 = link will run the last query or any saved query you've set as a default
UQP13S1 = To access a specific issue enter the issue number in the search form and click the button. If the id you requested is not found an error message will appear and you can enter a different id.
UQP13S2 = button. If the id you requested is not found an error message will appear and you can enter a different id.
UQP14 = Accessing issues across projects requires the following information:
UQP15 = permission to view issues in the target project
UQP16 = short name of the target project
UQP17 = issue number
UQP18S1 = For instance, jdoe is in the games (gam) project and wants to view an issue from the interface (int) project. Jdoe can enter INT1 and click the 
UQP18S2 = button to view the first issue in the Interface project.
UQP19 = If you do not have permission to view issues in the target project you will receive an error message. Likewise, if you enter an invalid project id or issue number an error message will be generated.
UQP20 = link explains the syntax used in a text query
UQP21 = generates a list of all issues with which you are associated.


##UserQueryText
UQT1 = Scarab uses a powerful search engine to find text within issues.  In many cases this functionality does not interfere with performing simple text searches.  But there are some cases where the search operators might cause problems if not escaped.  The most common problem is the '-' operator which must be escaped if it is being used as a hyphen.  Two ways to escape operators exist: the operator can be preceded by a '\\' backslash, or the term containing the operator can be quoted.  The quoting method works in cases where the term involves numbers whereas the backslash method will not, so if you are searching for a database error code, for example ORA-00932, you will need to enter the term in quotes within the search input field: "ORA-00932".  However if searching for a normal hyphenated word such as twenty-five, entering the search text as twenty\\-five or "twenty-five" will work.
UQT2 = General instructions for constructing a query follow:
UQT3 = A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases.
UQT4 = A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".
UQT4S2 = te?t 
UQT4S3 = To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.
UQT5 = A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".
UQT5S2 = test*
UQT6 = Single and multiple character wildcard searches.
UQT7 = To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.
UQT8 = To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.
UQT8S2 = roam~
UQT8S3 = This search will find terms like foam and roams.
UQT9 = Proximity Searches
UQT10 = Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search: test*
UQT10S2 = "jakarta apache"~10.
UQT11 = Note: You can use the wildcard searches in the middle or end of a term but not as the first character of a search.
UQT12 = Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS. If two terms are entered with no Boolean operator, the OR operator is used by default.
UQT13 = This search will find terms like foam and roams
UQT14 = The AND operator is used to find text that contains both terms anywhere in the text. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol &amp;&amp; can be used in place of the word AND.
UQT15 = The "+", or required, operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol exist somewhere in the text. To search for results that must contain "jakarta" and may contain "lucene" use the query: +jakarta lucene.
UQT16 = The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator links two terms and finds a match if either of the terms exist in the text. This is equivalent to a union using sets. The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR.
UQT17 = The AND operator matches where both terms exist anywhere in the text.  This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol &amp;&amp; can be used in place of the word AND.
UQT18 = Grouping
UQT19 = Grouping is supported using parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query.  To search for either "jakarta" or "apache" and "website" use the query: 
UQT19S2 = "jakarta apache" NOT "jakarta lucene"
UQT19S3 = This eliminates any confusion and makes sure you that website must exist and either term jakarta or apache may exist
UQT20 = Escaping Special Characters
UQT21 = Using any of the previously discussed characters or words, which would normally be interpreted as operators, within a term  can be achieved using escaping. Note: some operators exist for the underlying lucene search engine, but are not exposed in Scarab's usage.  These operators such as colon ":" need to be escaped. The current list special characters is: + - & || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \\ 
UQT22 = You can escape special characters by placing the term in quotes or by placing a '\\' (backslash) before the operator. You should always use quotes for search strings containing numbers. For example, if you are searching for a database error code, such as ORA-00932, you will need to enter the term in quotes in the search input field: "ORA-00932". However if searching for a normal hyphenated word such as twenty-five, entering the search text as twenty\\-five or "twenty-five" will work.
UQT23 = This eliminates any confusion and makes sure you that website must exist and either term jakarta or apache may exist.
UQT24 = The instructions given above are based on the lucene documentation at http://jakarta.apache.org/ lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html

## UserIssueTemplates
ManagingIssuesOverview = Overview
CreatingTemplates = Creating templates
IssueEntryTemplate = Issue entry templates
UITP1 = You may find you often enter the same values for attributes for similar issues. Templates allow you to save a set of values for quick access and use while creating issues. Templates store descriptive dataset that can be used to populate values in future issues. Templates use the same attributes as are available for entering an issue.
UITP2 = For instance, a user, jdoe, is responsible for creating and implementing test plans for all functionality on the UNIX operating system. Since jdoe will be entering the same values for each issue relating to test plans, jdoe can define a template with those common values. When creating issues, jdoe can use the template to populate the common data points. Fields populated using a template can be edited in the Enter New form.
UITP3 = Templates can be available on a global or individual basis. Personal templates can be made by any user and are available only to the creator. Global templates require permission to create. Users with the create permission can suggest new templates to the domain administrator. The administrator is responsible for reviewing all suggested templates and approving those that have global use.
UITP4S1 = To access your templates from the left naviagtion bar click on the 
TemplateList = Template list
UITP4S2 = link under your issue type. On the 
UITP4S3 = screen you will find a list of any templates currently available. You can either manage the templates there or create a new template.
UITP6 = Enter values into the Template details section. The name of your template should be short and descriptive. For instance, to create a template to enter defects affecting performance, you could name it "Performance" and use the description field to detail the types of performance issues this template covers.
UITP7 = Select the level of availability for the the template. Selecting personal will render the template available to the creator only. To make the template available globally you must have the permission to do so and/or go through an approval process (see Approvals).
UITP8 = Enter appropriate values in the Template Attributes section. Attributes appearing in this section are the same as appear in the

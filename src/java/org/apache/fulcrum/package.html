Contains the Service framework for Turbine.

<p>
Services are singletons that have pluggable implementation
and can participate in Turbine startup and shutdown.

<h3>What is a service?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Is a singleton -  there is only one instance of it in the system 
     i.e. memory or connections are allocated once only, and the internal
     state is common to all requesting clients.
<li> Has pluggable implementation - you can use your own implementation
     if you need, just change  an entry in Fulcrum.properties,
     and there you go.
<li> Can initialize itself (allocate memory, make connctions)
     just before the client requests it for the first time. Services that
     are never used by the application will not allocate resources.
<li> Can execute some action upon system shutdown e.g. close the 
     opened connections.
</ul>		  
<h3>The life cycle of a Service</h3>
<p>
A Service is not supposed to do much in it's constructor. Especialy it 
should not allocate any costly resources like large memory structures, 
DB or network connections and the like. It may well happen that the Service
is sitting in the config file, but the application does not 
need it, so allocating all resources at system startup might
be a loss.
<p>
Better explanation of early initialization. WebMacro is no longer
a service and what was currently here is misleading.
<p>
Late initialization happens when the Service is requested by the
application for the first time. It should allocate any resources
needed and chnge the state so that getInit() returns true.
If getInit() returns false after init() is executed, the Service 
has malfunctioned.
<p>
After late initialization, the Service is ready to perform actions
on behalf of the application.
<p>
When the Service is no longer needed (this usually happens when 
system is shutting down), the shutdown() method is called.
shutdown() should deallocate all resources. If any error conditions
occur they are ignored.

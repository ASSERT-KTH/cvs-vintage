/**
 * This is a Velocity EventCartridge Filter which is responsible
 * for processing $ variables when they are rendered in a template.
 * The current purpose of this filter is to process out CSS 
 * (cross site scripting) vulnerabilities. There is some commented 
 * out code that adds a bit of timing information to make sure that
 * the processing doesn't add to much overhead. In limited testing,
 * it looks like this class only adds about 0-2ms of processing time to
 * each request.

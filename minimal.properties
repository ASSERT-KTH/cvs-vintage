#
# This file contains the minimal set of properties which MUST
# be configured according to your individual environment.
# As starting point you can copy one of the two files below to 
# your individual $SCARAB_ROOT/build.properties file:
#
#    minimal.properties   this file (minimal modification set) 
#    project.properties             (full modification set)
#
# Using the minimal.properties as a starting point makes life
# much easier for the first time Scarab administrator.
#
# Please refer to the file
#
#     $SCARAB_HOME/project.properties 
#
# for more specific informations about the full available set
# of properties.
#
# QUICK instruction:
# ==================
# First choose your database type and ensure your database environment
# is fully installed and available. Then browse through this file
# and exchange every occurance of "hypersonic" with the database type
# of your choice. Of course if your database choice is already "hypersonic"
# just skip this first step.
# Then browse again through this file and adjust all other properties
# to your individual environmental situation.

# scarab.database.type
# --------------------
# This property defines, for which database the
# Scarab instance shall be built.
# The following values are currently allowed (the default value
# is underlined)
#
#   mysql, postgresql, hypersonic, mssql, oracle, db2
#                      ----------

scarab.database.type=hypersonic


# ------------------------
# scarab.database.username
# scarab.database.password
# ------------------------
# This is the username and password that Scarab uses to connect
# to the database instance when it's running.
# Note: The default setting is UNSAFE, because we don't use
# a password for the connection. Consider changing this in your
# productive environment.

scarab.database.username=sa
scarab.database.password=


# ------------------------------
# scarab.database.admin.username
# scarab.database.admin.password
# ------------------------------
# This is the username and password of the database user
# that should be used to create the Scarab database and
# tables.
# Note: The default setting is UNSAFE, because the db admin
# is set identical to the db user. Consider changing this in your
# productive environment.

scarab.database.admin.username=${scarab.database.username}
scarab.database.admin.password=${scarab.database.password}


# --------------------
# scarab.database.host
# --------------------
# The name of the host that the database is running on.
# Remind, that the host to be used must be known to the
# box, where the Scarab webapplication is started. The
# default setting assumes, that the database runs on the 
# same host as Scarab.

scarab.database.host=localhost


# --------------------
# scarab.database.port
# --------------------
# The port on which the database server is listening for
# connections. The default settings are for hypersonic.

scarab.database.port=${scarab.database.port.hypersonic}


# -------------------------
# scarab.database.url
# scarab.database.url.extension
# scarab.database.admin.url
# -------------------------
# These urls denote the JDBC connection strings for your database.
# scarab.database.url.extension defines the optional parameters
# to be sent along with the URL, i.e. the String after the "?" .
#

# --------------------
# scarab.database.name
# --------------------
# The name of the database that Scarab connects to.
# You will have to change this property only, if your
# database name differs from the default "scarab"
# This usually occurs when you plan to run multiple
# Scarba instances with different databases on the same host.

scarab.database.name=scarab


# --------------------
# scarab.user.username
# --------------------
# Scarab administration user.
# This is the account name of the administrator account
# in Scarab. After installation you can login to Scarab
# with that user name.
# Note: The initial password can not be preset here. It 
#       is always set to "1" (one, without the quotes)
#       and can be changed online from the administrator
#       acount.
#   
#       We recommend, that you change the initial password
#       immediately for security reasons.

scarab.user.username=Administrator


# -----------------------
# scarab.database.adapter
# -----------------------
# [FIXME] add documentation, what is this ?
#         How is it related to scarab.database.driver ?
#
# hypersonic, mysql
# ----------
#

scarab.database.adapter = ${scarab.database.type}


# ------------------------------------
# scarab.database.pool.validationQuery
# ------------------------------------
# [FIXME] add documentation

# scarab.database.pool.validationQuery = SELECT ATTRIBUTE_ID FROM SCARAB_ATTRIBUTE WHERE ATTRIBUTE_ID='0'
#
# mysql:
# scarab.database.pool.validationQuery = SELECT 1
# 

scarab.database.pool.validationQuery=${scarab.database.pool.validationQuery.hypersonic}


# ------------------------------------
# scarab.database.jdbc.driver
# ------------------------------------
# [FIXME] add documentation
#
# hypersonic: 
# scarab.database.jdbc.driver = org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
#
# mysql (default):
# scarab.database.jdbc.driver = org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver

# ----------------
# system.mail.host
# ----------------
# This is the host on which your Email service runs
# as seen from Scarab. This is usually a named host, e.g.
# mailserver.mydomain.com. If the mail service runs
# on the same host as Scarab, you can use the default (localhost)

system.mail.host = localhost


# -------------------
# scarab.email.domain

# -----------------------------
# scarab.email.default.fromName

# each Email it sends to the world. Please note, that some
# Email services insist on finding a locally existing mailuser 
# in this field.

scarab.email.default.fromName = Administrator


# --------------------------------------
# Application server related properties
#
# scarab.http.scheme is the protocol to be used. In most situations 
# this will be "http" (the default setting). 
# In rare situations you may want to use "https". In that case 
# you will also have to setup your appserver to support https.
#
# scarab.http.domain is the www adress under which your scarab instance 
# is served, e.g. www.mydomain.com
#
# scarab.http.port is the (optional) port under which your scarab 
# instance is served, e.g. 8080. If you are running your appserver 
# through a http-proxy or directly on port 80, please set
#
#     scarab.http.port=80
#
# scarab.context is the webapplication context under which your scarab 
# instance is adressed on the appserver, e.g. "scarab"
# 
# The default setting resolves to:
#
# http://localhost:8080/scarab

scarab.http.scheme                = http
scarab.http.domain                = localhost

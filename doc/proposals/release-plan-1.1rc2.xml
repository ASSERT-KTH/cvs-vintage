  <p>The objective of the <strong>Struts 1.1 Release Candidate 2</strong>
  release is to create a milestone release in preparation for an imminent
  <strong>Struts 1.1 Final</strong> release. As a release candidate, this
  milestone release currently contains no known showstoppers.</p>

  </section>


  <section name="The Plan" href="Plan">

  <p>A number of bugs have been fixed since and other internal changes made
  since the first release candidate of Struts 1.1.
  All remaining tickets have been categorized either as enhancements, or as
  problems which can be fixed in a release subsequent to Struts 1.1 Final.
  Therefore it is time to make the latest code base available as a first Release
  Candidate. The goal is to move towards a final <strong>Struts 1.1</strong>
  release as soon as is practicable. </p>

      <p>
          This release candidate includes the Commons FileUpload RC1 JAR,
          which is required to compile and use Struts 1.1.
          A final release of Struts must depend only on final releases of other
          required products. Consequently, the Struts 1.1 Final release cannot
          be made unitl the Commons FileUpload 1.0 Final Release is available.
      </p>

      <p>
          However, Pending the final release of Commons FileUpload 1.0,
          and should there be no showstoppers found in this release candidate,
          <b>Sunday June 29, 2003</b>, is set as the anticipated release date of
          Struts 1.1 Final.
          Anyone wishing to test the product before the final release
          is encourged to do so before that date.
      </p>

  <p>Therefore, the following release plan is proposed for Struts 1.1 Release Candidate 2:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>Code Freeze / Tag Date</em> - Friday, June 6, 2003, 23:59:59</li>
  <li><em>Release Manager</em> - Ted Husted</li>
  <li><em>Release Announcement</em> - To the following mailing lists:
      <ul>
      <li>announcements@jakarta.apache.org</li>
      <li>struts-dev@jakarta.apache.org</li>
      <li>struts-user@jakarta.apache.org</li>
      </ul></li>
  </ul>

      <p>
          This plan is being prepared and executed in accordance with a positive vote
          held on the STRUT-DEV list, beginning on May 29,
          the results of which were posted on June 3, 2003.
      </p>

      <p>
          The release process shall follow the same
          <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/releases/">general procedures</a>
          established the Jakarta Commons products.
      </p>

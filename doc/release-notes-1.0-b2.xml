    <p>The binary distribution of this release includes the following
    files relevant to Struts 1.0:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>INSTALL</code> - </li>
    <li><code>LICENSE</code> - The Apache Software Foundation license that
        defines the terms under which you can use Struts (and other software
        licensed by Apache).</li>
    <li><code>README</code> - </li>
    <li><code>etc/</code> - Directory containing the Ant build scripts
        used to construct the Struts binary release.  These are useful
        as examples of how Ant can be used, but are not required to use
        Struts in your own applications.</li>
    <li><code>lib/</code> - Directory containing files you will need in
        your own applications.  The individual files of interest are:
        <ul>
        <li><code>struts.jar</code> - JAR file that contains the compiled
            Java classes for both version 0.5 and 1.0 of Struts.  You must
            place this file in the <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of
            your web application.</li>
        <li><code>struts-xxxxx.tld</code> - The tag library descriptor files
            for the Struts 1.0 tag libraries (bean, html, logic, and
            template).  You must place these files in the <code>/WEB-INF</code>
            directory of your web application, and reference them with
            appropriate <code>&lt;taglib&gt;</code> directives in your
            web.xml file.  <strong>NOTE</strong> - The struts-form.tld
            file is deprecated; you should use the struts-html.tld file
            instead.</li>
        <li><code>jdbc2_0-stdext.jar</code> - The JDBC 2.0 Optional Package
            API classes (package <code>javax.sql</code>).  You will need to
            include this file in the <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code> directory
            of your application, if it is not already made visible to web
            applications by your servlet container.</li>
        <li><code>struts-config_1_0.dtd</code> - The document type descriptor
            (DTD) for the Struts configuration file (which is typically named
            <code>/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml</code>.  Your configuration file
            will be validated against an internal copy of this DTD -- this
            copy is available for reference purposes only.</li>
        <li><code>web-app_2_2.dtd</code> - The document type descriptor (DTD)
            for web.xml files conforming to the Servlet 2.2 specification.

    <li><code>src/</code> - Directory containing the Java source code for the
        entire Struts framework, for reference purposes.  <strong>NOTE</strong>
        - if you wish to build Struts from scratch, you should download and
        install the Struts Source Distribution instead of trying to build
        from this directory.</li>
    <li><code>webapps/</code> - Web Application Archive (WAR) files for the
        web applications that are included with Struts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For backwards compatibility only, the binary distribution also

        your own applications.  The individual files of interest are:
        <ul>
        <li><code>struts.jar</code> - JAR file that contains the compiled
            Java classes for both version 0.5 and 1.0 of Struts.  You must
            place this file in the <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of
            your web application.</li>
        <li><code>struts.tld</code> - The tag library descriptor file for

            directives in your web.xml file.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

  <section name="What's New?" href="New">

    <p><strong>DEPRECATIONS</strong> - The entire custom tag library
    that is documented in <code>struts.tld</code> has been deprecated.
    These tags correspond to the Struts 0.5 functionality that is also
    deprecated, and have been replaced (and considerably enhanced) in
    the various individual tag libraries.</p>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the basic controller
    framework (package <code>org.apache.struts.action</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You can now specify that an <code>&lt;action&gt;</code> element should
        invoke an existing servlet or JSP page resource, rather than calling an
        <code>Action</code> class, by using the <code>include</code> attribute
        rather than the <code>type</code> attribute.  The standard form bean
        processing provided by the controller is still performed first, if you
        have configured it, so the included resource can benefit from this
        processing if it wishes to.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the
    <em>struts-html</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code> tag now accepts an optional
        <code>anchor</code> attribute, to allow the inclusion of a
        (possibly calculated) anchor ("#xxx") in the generated hyperlink.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:base&gt;</code> tag now accepts an optional
        <code>target</code> attribute.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:image&gt;</code> tag now accepts an optional
        <code>border</code> attribute, to define the border with around
        this image.</li>
    <li>You can now request that the <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code> tag
        include any current transaction control token in the generated
        hyperlink, by specifying the <code>transaction</code> attribute
        with a value of <code>true</code>.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:options&gt;</code> tag now supports Enumeration
        for the <code>collection</code> property.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the
    <em>struts-logic</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.logic</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>&lt;logic:iterate&gt;</code> tag now supports Enumeration
        for the <code>collection</code> property.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the
    <em>struts-template</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.template</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Attribute getter methods have been added to all of the custom
        tag implementation classes to facilitate reuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following new features have been added to the Struts Documentation
    application (and corresponding contents on the Struts web site):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Platform specific installation notes for a wide variety of application
        server and servlet container environments have been accumulated and
        published.</li>
    </ul>

  <section name="Changes and Bug Fixes" href="Changes">

    <p>The following changes and bug fixes have occured in the
    <em>struts-html</em> custom tag library (package
    <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html</code>):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:image&gt;</code> tag now correctly generates a
        closing double quote on the <code>name</code> attribute.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:form&gt;</code> tag now generates a hyperlink
        that includes any query parameters that were included in the original
        hyperlink value.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code> tag now correctly places any
        specified anchor ("#xxx") in the generated hyperlink.</li>
    <li>The JavaScript code generated to implement the <code>focus</code>
        attribute of the <code>&lt;html:form&gt;</code> tag now works even
        when you use nested or indexed property expressions.  Previously,
        this would generate an invalid JavaScript reference to the field.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;html:checkbox&gt;</code> tag now conforms to its
        documentation, and sends the specified <code>value</code> to the
        server if this checkbox is checked at submit time.  In addition, a
        default value of <code>on</code> is sent if no value attribute is
        specified.</li>
    <li>The hyperlinks created by the <code>&lt;html:link&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;html:redirect&gt;</code> tags now properly omit the port
        number if it is the default port for the current request scheme (80
        for http, or 443 for https).  Among other things, this corrects
        session management behavior on the standard port numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Struts Documentation
    application (and corresponding contents on the Struts web site) have
    occurred:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The Java types of collections (and arrays) over which the
        <code>&lt;logic:iterate&gt;</code> tag can run are now documented.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;bean:define&gt;</code> documentation now mentions the
        JSP 1.1 Specification restriction on using more than one
        <code>id</code> attribute with the same value in the same page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following changes and bug fixes to the Struts Example Applications
    have occurred:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The Java source code of these applications is now included in the
        corresponding WAR files, in subdirectory <code>WEB-INF/src</code>.</li>
    <li>Excessive filter() calls in <code>LinkSubscriptionTag</code>
        have been eliminated.</li>
    <li>Calls to the deprecated <code>BeanUtils.filter()</code> have been
        replaced by calls to <code>ResponseUtils.filter()</code>.</li>
    </ul>

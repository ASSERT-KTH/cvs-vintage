<section href="checkbox" name="Why are my checkboxes not being set from ON to OFF?">
<p>
A problem with a checkbox is that the browser will only include it in the request 
when it is checked. If it is not checked, the HTML specification suggests that it 
not be sent (i.e. omitted from the request). If the value of the checkbox is being 
persisted, either in a session bean or in the model, a checked box can never 
unchecked by a HTML form -- because the form can never send a signal to uncheck 
the box. The application must somehow ascertain that since the element was not 
sent that the corresponding value is unchecked.
</p>
<p>
The recommended approach for Struts applications is to use the reset method in the 
ActionForm to set all properties represented by checkboxes to null or false. The 
checked boxes submitted by the form will then set those properties to true. The 
omitted properties will remain false. Another solution is to use radio buttons 
instead, which always submit a value. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that the HTML specification recommends this same 
behavior whenever a control is not "successful". Any blank element in a HTML 
form is not guaranteed to submitted. It is therefor very important to set the 
default values for an ActionForm correctly, and to implement the reset method 
when the ActionForm might kept in session scope.

The core of the Struts framework is a flexible control layer based on standard
technologies like Java Servlets, JavaBeans, ResourceBundles, 
and Extensible Markup Language (XML), as well as various Jakarta Commons packages.
Struts encourages application architectures based on the Model 2 approach, a variation
of the classic  Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.

Struts provides its own Controller component and integrates with other technologies
to provide the Model and the View. For the Model, Struts can interact with any standard
data access technology, including Enterprise Java Beans, JDBC, and Object Relational Bridge.
For the View, Struts works well with JavaServer Pages, including JSTL and JSF, 
as well as Velocity Templates, XSLT, and other presentation systems.

The Struts framework provides the invisible underpinnings every professional 
web application needs to survive. Struts helps you create an extensible 
development environment for your application, based on published standards
and proven design patterns.

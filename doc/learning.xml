  <p>
  The <b>official documentation</b> for the framework is provided both online
  and as a self-installing WAR in the distribution. The
  <code>struts-documentation.war</code> includes our
  <a href="./faqs/index.html">FAQs and Howtos</a>,
  <a href="./faqs/newbie.html">Newbie</a> along with the
  <a href="userGuide/index.html">Users Guide</a>,
  <a href="api/index.html">Javadocs</a>, and everything else you find here.
  You are invited to preview the documentation online, and then install the
  application locally for closer study.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Note: Most of the links in this section refer to the <b>Nightly Build</b>.
  When learning about Struts, <b>be sure to refer to the documentation for the
  version you are actually using</b>. The documentation is bundled with each
  distribution as an application that you can install locally. Links to the
  documentation for the current stable release (1.0.2) are also provided on the
  menu bar. Whenever possible, please help conserve our bandwidth, and install
  the documentation locally.

  The <a href="./faqs/kickstart.html"><b>Kickstart FAQ</b></a> answers the most common
  non-technical questions people first ask about Struts. The
  <a href="./faqs/newbie.html">Struts Newbie FAQ</a> answers the most common
  technical questions asked by first-timer Struts developers. The
  <a href="./faqs/helping.html">How to Help</a> FAQ answers the most common questions
  about contributing to the Jakarta-Struts project. A more extensive
  Struts knowledgebase is available at the
  <a href="http://jguru.com/faq/Struts">JGuru FAQ</a> and
  <a href="http://jguru.com/forums/Struts">Forum</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The concise Struts <a href="userGuide/index.html"><b>Users Guide</b></a> introduces the
  Model-View-Controller architecture, and how it relates to the major components of Struts.
  To help you get started with the Struts JSP tag extensions and utility packages,
  several <b>Developer Guides</b> supplement the Users Guide. The Users Guide also
  includes detailed installation instructions and release notes for each version of the
  framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  For more detail about a specific class or package, the Struts
  <a href="api/index.html"><b>Javadocs</b></a>
  are <b>surprisingly comprehensive and carefully maintained</b>. It is <i>strongly</i> recommended that
  you refer to the
  <a href="api/index.html">
  Javadoc</a> for each class as you begin to use it, to be sure important features
  and options are not overlooked. <i>What you don't know, can't help you.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  Of course, the only true documentation is the code itself. If you have any questions
  about how Struts actually works, do not hesitate to <i>use the source</i>. For the
  complete, buildable source code to the entire Struts framework, see the "src" folder in
  the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/release/v1.0.2/src/">
  <b>Struts 1.0.2 source distribution</b></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts <a href="#Involved">Mailing Lists</a> are a treasure trove of useful,
  interactive information. The user list tends to carry a high volume, so always check
  the published documentation and the
  <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=42">
  <b>MAILING LIST ARCHIVE</b></a> before
  <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">posting a new question</a>.
  Like as not, it's already been asked and answered.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you really can't find the answer to your question in the <a href="#faqs">FAQs</a> or
  <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=42">list archive</a>,
  you can post your query to the Struts User list -- <b>BUT YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE TO THE
  <a href="mailto:struts-user-subscribe@jakarta.apache.org">USER LIST</a>
  OR THE
  <a href="mailto:struts-user-digest-subscribe@jakarta.apache.org">USER LIST DIGEST</a>
  BEFORE POSTING</b>. If you would rather not subscribe to a list, you can go through the
  <a href="http://www.proj.com/subscribe.jsp">BaseBeans Struts Newsgroup</a> instead.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Please note that the Struts User list enjoys a "casual friday" policy. More off-topic
  messages are tolerated on Fridays so long as the message is prefixed with the token
  [FRIDAY]. If you'd rather not be troubled by these postings, please set your
  mail filter accordingly. Posting [FRIDAY] articles on any other weekday is <b>strongly
  discouraged</b>. We thank you for your cooperation.

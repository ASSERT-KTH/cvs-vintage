<h3><a name="20021227"></a>27 Dec 2002 - Java Development with Ant</h3>
    <p>
        I'm proud (and worried about the support e-mails! :) to announce the near-final release of a project
        demonstrating Ant, XDoclet, Struts, JUnit, Cactus, and Lucene.
        Its called JavaDevWithAnt as it was written for the book Steve and I co-authored and has been refined
        during several presentations I've been giving on Ant, XDoclet and Struts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The documentation is in draft stage, and my primary goal is to collect feedback on polishing the documentation
        (and the application if there are any bugs that surface).
        The site where I'm hosting the distribution and documentation is:
    </p>
    <p>
       <a href="http://www.ehatchersolutions.com/JavaDevWithAnt/">http://www.ehatchersolutions.com/JavaDevWithAnt/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please let me know if you try it out and have suggestions for improvement,
        or just to let me know you tried it and hate it or love it, etc.
        Feedback more than welcome!
        Direct feedback to me at
        <a href="mailto:JavaDevWithAnt@ehatchersolutions.com">JavaDevWithAnt@ehatchersolutions.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        p.s. Since this is directed to the Struts lists, here are some hilights:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
    - XDoclet generation of struts-config.xml and validation.xml
        </li>
        <li>
    - Custom XDoclet generation of starter JSP and application properties based on form bean source code
        </li>
        <li>
    - My proudest taglib, LabelTag - shows fields in error and marks required fields with an asterisk.
        </li>
        <li>
    - Use of StrutsTestCase in Cactus mode to test a Struts Action.
        </li>

<h3><a name="2002117"></a>17 Nov 2002 - Struts At ApacheCon 2002</h3>
<p>
If you're coming to Las Vegas this week for ApacheCon, there will be two
sessions and a Birds of Feather meet specifically focused on Struts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Session TU07 (Tuesday, 1:30-2:30) - What's New In Struts 1.1
</li>
<li>
  Session WE06 (Wednesday, 10:00-11:00) - Building Web Applications
  With Struts

  BOF BOF03 (Tuesday, 8:00p-9:00p) - Struts After 1.1 -- Where Do We
  Go From Here?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The BOF is primarily an opportunity to gather input from folks on our
initial thinking about the 1.2 and 2.0 roadmaps, and to answer any general
questions that people have.
</p>
<p>
The sessions and BOF will be lead by Craig McClanahan. Craig looks forward 
to meeting any Struts users (and developers) attending the
conference. You can find him at one of these sessions, or hanging around
the Sun booths in the Exhibit Hall.

<h3><a name="20021115.2"></a>15 Nov 2002 - Struts ImageButtonBeanManager v0.2d</h3>
<p>
Version 0.2d of the ImageButtonBeanManager is now available on 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imagebuttonbean/">SourceForge.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
ImageButtonBeanManager is a Struts Extension Package that supports the Struts
HTML Image Tag and the ImageButtonBean class in a manner that is analgous to
the support provided by Struts for the Struts HTML Submit Tag.
</p>

<p>
It extends Ted Husted's 
<a href="http://husted.com/struts/tips/001.html">ImageButtonBean</a> 
approach with a few new features, such as automatically mapping the selected 
ImageButton to an ActionForward and eliminating the need to define ImageButtonBean 
instances in the ActionForm.  
</p>

<p>
It builds on this capability and adds some features for similar support of the
SubmitButton, yielding several new DispatchAction classes. The DispatchAction
classes can be used to develop "Action Flows", which are analgous to
server-side Action scripts. "Action Flows" are discussed in detail in the 
documentation (please see the 
"<a href="http://imagebuttonbeanmgr.webhop.org/">DispatchAction Classes page</a>".)
</p>

<p>
The ImageButtonBeanManager DispatchAction classes are "ready-to-use" in that
they don't need to be extended or require any application-specific code.  They
can be used in lieu of an application's extensions of the Struts DispatchAction
or LookupDispatchAction classes. They have the potential for relieving much of
the dispatching duties of application-specific Actions. That should bring the
side benefit of reducing the level of coupling between JSPs and Actions.
</p>

<p>
Larger development projects might get more benefit from this than smaller ones
...
</p>

<p>

<h3><a name="20021115"></a>15 Nov 2002 - [FRIDAY] Top 10 things likely to be overheard from a Klingon Programmer</h3>
<p>
From: Andrew Hill
</p>
<p>
10. Specifications are for the weak and timid!
</p>
<p>
9. You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you
stand!
</p>
<p>
8. Indentation?! - I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!
</p>
<p>
7. What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software 'releases'.
Our software 'escapes' leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality
assurance people in its wake.
</p>
<p>
6. Klingon function calls do not have 'parameters' - they have 'arguments' -
and they ALWAYS WIN THEM.
</p>
<p>
5. Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak.
</p>
<p>
4. A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment on his code!
Klingon software does NOT have BUGS. It has FEATURES, and those features are
too sophisticated for a Romulan pig like you to understand.
</p>
<p>
3. You cannot truly appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the original
Klingon.
</p>
<p>
2. Our users will know fear and cower before our software!
</p>
<p>
1. Ship it! Ship it and let them flee like the dogs they are!

<h3><a name="20021113"></a>13 Nov 2002 - Tiles and Validator Support in ObjectAssembler 2.5</h3>
<p>
ObjectAssembler 2.5 Pro is now available:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.objectventure.com/objectassembler.html">http://www.objectventure.com/objectassembler.html</a>
</p>
<p>
New Struts features in this release:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Full support for Tiles definitions
</li>
<li>
    Full support for Validator 1.0 configurations
</li>
<li>
    Jump from any element in our visual editor to its associated XML
</li>
<li>
    Two-way development. Changes made to XML are immediately reflected in
    the visual editor and vice versa
</li>
<li>
    Two additional component types: Struts Exception and Validator
    (allows the implementation of Validator rules). For each of these
    components that are created, their use is automated in the Struts,
    Tiles, and Validator configuration editor
</li> 
<li>
    Updated all Struts support to the latest 1.1 builds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
ObjectAssembler doesn't just help you generate configuration files. It
is a component-based Struts development environment that assists you in
building both Struts components and configuration files. It also
automates the process of packaging them in a WAR and generating the WAR
itself.
</p>
<p>
ObjectAssembler is currently supported in Jbuilder, Netbeans, Sun ONE
Studio, and as a standalone IDE. We are working on the next supported
IDE (the most popular requests being IDEA and Eclipse).
</p>
<p>
I invite you to take ObjectAssembler for a spin. The User Manual, which
is provided with the installation, explains how to make use of
ObjectAssembler's Struts support. We also have some simple Struts
Viewlets available here if you aren't quite up to downloading yet:

<h3><a name="20021112"></a>12 Nov 2002 - display tag: added columns functionality</h3>
<p>
In recent weeks I've noticed several people inquire about Ed Hill's
awesome 
<a href=" http://edhill.its.uiowa.edu/display-0.8/">display tag</a>
and the ability to only display certain columns.
</p>
<p>
I modified the jar and tld so that you can now provide a
"columnsToDisplay" attribute in the display:table tag.
columnsToDisplay just needs to be a String array of the columns you
want to display. The only caveat is the Strings in the array should
represent the titles of the columns and not the names of the fields.
(I suppose I should change that, but I wasn't sure if it would still
work when you use one of the table decorators. It shouldn't be a problem,
though, so I'll probably change that).
</p>
<p>
If anyone wants the jar/tld feel free to e-mail me or if I hear from
Ed, I'll see if he wants to include it in his latest release or I
could provide a link to the code somewhere else.

<h3><a name="20021106"></a>06 Nov 2002 - Struts News Roundup</h3>
<p>
The
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/volunteers.html">Struts team</a> is proud to welcome 4 new Committers this month, David Karr, Eddie Bush, David Graham, and James Mitchell</p>
<p>
Everyone is working steadily toward the release of Struts 1.1 beta 3. To help keep everyone on track, the team added a
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/status.html">Development Roadmap</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of "nice to haves" that won't make Struts 1.1 which are now slated for Struts 1.2. Farther down the road, Struts 2.0 will rely upon the new standards, like JavaServer Faces and JSTL.
</p>
<p>
The platform for Struts 1.1 will remain Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1. However, a Struts JSTL taglib is available in the nightly build contrib directory and will be released with Struts 1.1 as a separate download.
</p>
<p>
Solid Struts support for the other new standard,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/proposals/struts-faces.html">Struts JavaServer Faces</a>,
is under development, but cannot be released quite yet.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Struts User list will continue to enjoy its "casual Friday" policy. Off-topic messages are tolerated on Fridays so long as the message is prefixed with the token [FRIDAY]. Posting [FRIDAY] articles on any other weekday is strongly discouraged.

<h3><a name="20021105.2"></a>2002 Nov 05 - Struts Article on theServerSide.com</h3>
<p>
An article on Struts has been published on www.theServerSide.com. This
article titled 'Fast Track to Struts: What it Does and How' is primarily
written to assist new users get quickly familiar with Struts. It is
complementary to the information already available at
http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/userGuide/index.html. I am hoping that this
article will complement the efforts of the people already evangelizing
Struts adoption.
</p>
<p>
The introduction to the article is reproduced below.
</p>
<p>
Introduction<br />
------------<br />
The objective of this article is to introduce prospective Struts users to
the key benefits of using Struts, and at the same time illustrate its
configuration and usage semantics. We will define the requirements of a
robust presentation framework and simultaneously discuss how these
requirements are implemented in the Struts framework. We will also explore
the design patterns implemented by Struts, the semantics of the controller,
and the semantics of the associated helper components; this knowledge will
be useful when designing components that will interact with the framework,
and when there is a need for extending the framework for accommodating
special needs of a project. This article complements the information
available at http://jakarta.apache.org/struts.

<h3><a name="20021101"></a>2002 Nov 01 - New Struts Article posted on OnJava</h3>
<p>
Sorry for the self promotion, but I thought this article

that is discussed here on the list frequently, but never

    <h3><a name="20021002"></a>02 Oct 2002  - Struts-EL contrib library (Struts &amp; JSTL)</h3>
    <p>
        The Struts-EL contrib library is now available in the nightly build, as of build 20021002.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Struts-EL tag library is an extension of the Struts tag library (at
        least
        the "bean", "html", and "logic" portions).  Each JSP custom tag in this
        library is a subclass of an associated tag in the Struts tag library.  The
        basic difference is that this tag library does not use "rtexprvalues", it
        uses
        the expression evaluation engine in the JSP Standard Tag Library (version
        1.0)
        to evaluate attribute values.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of the tags in this library are "ported" from the Struts tag library,
        with
        the same attributes (except for one each added to "logic:match" and
        "logic:notMatch") and functionality.  However, some of the Struts tags were
        not
        ported to this library.  This is the case for several tags whose
        functionality
        is completely covered by the JSTL tag library ("bean:write", for instance,
        being covered by "c:out" in the JSTL).
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to fully understand the correct utilization of this library, you
        must
        understand the use and operation of the Struts tag library, and the use and
        operation of the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (hereafter called the
        "JSTL"), along with the expression language (sometimes called the "EL") used
        for evaluating attribute values.  At this point in time, there is only very
        little documentation for the Struts-EL library.  There is a "README.txt"
        file
        at the root of the distribution which provides some basic information.  At
        some
        future time, the documentation for Struts-EL may be generated just like the
        Struts documentation.  However, as this library is really just a pure
        combination of the Struts tag library with the JSTL EL engine, there isn't a
        great deal more additional information that would be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the use of JSTL 1.0 requires the use of a JSP 1.2-compliant web
        container.  As a result, Struts-EL also requires a JSP 1.2-compliant web
        container.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Struts-EL distribution is provided as part of the Struts distribution,
        as a
        "contrib" library.  Just like the normal Struts distribution, there is a
        "strutsel-exercise-taglib" web application, which is a simple application
        used
        for demonstrating many of the tags and their features.  This version of the
        application covers a few more tags than the example in the base library, and
        also provides a "Source" feature, to view the source online.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want a quick example of what you can do with Struts-EL, imagine what
        you
        normally have to do if you're using LabelValueBean in your Action code to
        populate a symbolic value and a message resource key, and displaying that
        resulting string in your JSP page.
    </p>
    <p>
        You would normally have a pair of lines like this in your JSP page
        (hopefully
        I've got my syntax correct, as I'm entering this cold):
    </p>
    <p>
          &lt;bean:define id="foo" name="labelValueBean" property="label"/>
          &lt;bean:message key='&lt;%= foo.toString() %>'/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Using Struts-EL, it would look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
          &lt;bean-el:message key="${labelValueBean.label}"/>
    </p>

<h3><a name="20020910"></a>2002 Sep 10 - ApplicationResources.properties from Database</h3>
<p>
For anyone interested, I have finished implementing DBMessageResources
which allows you to keep the key-value pairs (from your
ApplicationResources.properties) in a single database table.
</p>
<p>
You can load your property files into a table (generic schema is provided)
and with this extension, by only modifying &lt;message-resources> in the
struts-config.xml your application will run WITHOUT ANY code changes. (See
the readme.txt file included)
</p>
<p>
This extension uses OJB (http://jakarta.apache.org/ojb) O/R mapping for
database configuration and connection pool management.
</p>
<p>
I have included a modified version of the (1.1b2) struts-example to
demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
I have tested this with Struts 1.1b2, and I'm sure it will work with 1.1b1
(If anyone requires a 1.0.x compatible, I can look at that also)
</p>
<p>
I will get this project available as soon as I work through some cvs issues
on sf.net:
</p>
<p>
If anyone is REALLY itching to get their hands on it sooner, send me a
<a href="mailto:jmitchell@apache.org">email</a>.
</p>
<p>
For those who were waiting, thanks for your patience.

<p>
Q1: It is recommended properties of the FormBeans should be String
properties. In that case, where do I do the type conversions?
</p>
<p>
Q2: How much does Struts depend on the session object and when is the
object created?
</p>
<p>
Q3: I have problem with using ActionErrors and &lt;html:errors>. I don't see
my messages. Why?
</p>
<p>
Q4: My error messages generated by &lt;html:errors> contain "null" at the
start and the end. What have I done wrong?
</p>
<p>
Q5: How do I prevent my form from being validated when it is displayed the
first time, if the JSP is fronted by an Action?
</p>
<p>
Q6: Struts 1.1 seems to support multiple resource bundles. How to use it?
</p>
<p>
Q7: After I replace my &lt;input type="submit"...> to &lt;html:submit...>, my
Javascript document.forms[0].submit() does not work anymore and returns me
"Object doesn't support this property or method". Why?
</p>
<p>
Q8: How do I configure Struts to intercept requests and perform some logic
before passing them to the controller servlet for processing?
</p>
<p>
Q9: How do I send binary data to the controller servlet? (e.g. a
Swing-based client sends serialized object to the controller servlet.)
</p>
<p>
Q10: I want to associate data with &lt;html:check> and return the selected
value as a String property in the FormBean. But I got exception coming from
RequestUtils.populate(). Why?

<h3><a name="20020905"></a>2002 Sep 05 - Struts 1.1: Should I Upgrade?</h3>
<p>
Built on the success of Struts 1.0, Struts 1.1 beta was released in March
this year and showcased at JavaOne 2002. This article describes the new
features found in Apache Struts 1.1 beta and the impact of migration from
Struts 1.0 to Struts 1.1. It also offers advice on the migration decision
and the upgrade process.

<h3><a name=""></a>Map -&gt; JavaBean API, arbitrary property names! dynclass.sourceforge.net</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://dynclass.sourceforge.net/">http://dynclass.sourceforge.net/</a> - a Class-creation API with very simple but powerful Map-to-JavaBeans translation.
</p>
<p>
I have recently added support for arbitrary property names (i.e. names
that contain spaces, operator chars, you name it).  So for example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Map myMap = ...;
myMap.put("email address", emailAddr);
Object myBean = BeanCreator.createBeanFromMap(myMap);

//...
&lt;bean:write name='myBean' property='email address'/>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Much better than lots of Bean inner-classes!
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of Struts developers are using DynaBean et al and it seems to be working fine for
them.  If you need your beans to work within non-DynaBean-aware
frameworks this API would be a big help to you.

    <h3><a name="20030328"></a>28 Mar 2003 - StrutsDoc</h3>
    <p>
        StrutsDoc allows you to generate two new types of taglib documentation.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>TaglibDoc<br />
                This is a JavaDoc-like set of html and css files for browsing the taglib documentation.
            </li>
            <li>TaglibReport<br />
                This target will generate a grid-like view of the taglibs and their attributes so that you can see
                every tag in a typical package side by side.
                This helps when comparing which tags implement a certain attribute, by allowing you to view them side
                by side and not have to look up each tag by hand.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        StrutsDoc is available at the Struts SourceForge site: <a href="http://struts.sf.net/strutsdoc/index.html">

    <h3><a name="20030327"></a>27 Mar 2003 - Tampa/St.Pete Struts User Group</h3>
    <p>
        The Atlanta Struts group meeting I went to this past Tuesday was great.
        Unfortunately I don't think I can't make that drive up that often so I
        was wondering if anyone was interested in getting a group together here
        in the Tampa Bay Florida area?
    </p>
    <p>
        I started a struts-tampa list here:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/struts-tampa/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/struts-tampa/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Best to post on the above list, but feel free to e-mail me off list if
        you like.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope to hear from you.

    <h3><a name="20030325"></a>25 Mar 2003 - Scripting Actions with BSF</h3>
    <p>
        I put together some code that allows Struts Actions to be written in the
        scripting language of one's choice rather than as Java classes. It uses
        the Beans Scripting Framework to allow scripts to be written in any
        language BSF supports like Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, BeanShell, and
        I believe even VBScript. Currently, I've hardcoded it to use BeanShell,
        but support for other languages will be soon coming.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the code, I modified the Struts example to exclusively use
        scripted Actions.  I've never written BeanShell before today, so I'm sure
        there are plenty of areas to improve.
    </p>
    <p>
        As fate would have it, as I finished the struts-example demo, idle
        googling found another project doing the same thing in pretty much the
        same way: IBM Alphaworks Struts Scripting. Unfortunately, I don't believe
        IBM's license is exactly open source, so perhaps there is still a need for
        this project. If anyone knows anything further, please, do share.
    </p>
    <p>
        Comments, suggestions, contributions welcome.

    <p>
        The inaugural meeting of the Silicon Valley Struts user group will be a
        dinner meeting at 7:30pm on Wednesday, April 2nd, in Palo Alto at Jing Jing:
    </p>
    <p>
          <a href="http://www.jingjingonline.com/">http://www.jingjingonline.com/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please send your RSVPs directly to me by noon on
        April 2nd. I have participated in several group meals at this restaurant and
        the food is excellent. There are also plenty of vegetarian options to choose
        from. I hope you can join us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please come prepared to discuss group logistics going forward. For starters:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. What topics you would like to see covered at future meetings.<br />
        2. Any suggestions you have with respect to potential speakers or meeting
        venues. If you have contacts that might help us with lining up suggested
        speakers or meeting venues, that would be even better.<br />
        3. Of course, we will take some time to find out a bit about each other and
        our own experiences with Struts too.
    </p>
    <p>
        P.S. If you would like to get future struts-silicon-valley announcements,
        you can join our mailing list here:

    <h3><a name="20030318"></a>18 Mar 2003 - Struts-Faces Integration Library Available</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>Struts-Faces Integration Library</em> is an add-on library
      that supports the use of
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">JavaServer Faces</a>
      user interface technology in a Struts-based web application, in place of
      the Struts custom tag libraries.  As a proof of concept, it also
      includes the canonical "struts-example" example web application,
      converted to use JavaServer Faces Tags, as well as tags from the JSP
      Standard Tag Library (JSTL), version 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source code for this library is in the
      <code>contrib/struts-faces</code> directory of the Struts CVS repository,
      and nightly builds are available at:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly/struts-faces/">
        http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly/struts-faces/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This library is EA quality code, and is not going to be integrated into
      standard Struts releases until it has matured further, and until
      JavaServer Faces goes to 1.0 final release status.  The library requires
      a Struts 1.1 nightly build (20030216 or later), or the upcoming 1.1 RC2
      or 1.1 final releases.  It also requires the EA3 version of the
      JavaServer Faces reference implementation, available via:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/download.html">
      http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/download.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Struts-Faces integration download includes source code for the
      library (useful to see how the integration was accomplished, and also
      to learn how to build custom JavaServer Faces component and renderer
      classes), as well as an extensive <code>README.txt</code> that documents
      how to utilize the library in your own applications.

    <h3><a name="20030310"></a>10 Mar 2003 - Struttin' With Struts beta (newbies esp. welcome)</h3>
    <p>
        I created a web site that walks new Struts users step by step
        through the development of three VERY simple web applications in three
        lessons. Each lesson adds a few more features so that they build upon
        each other yet each stands alone such that if you follow the steps in
        any lesson you'll have built a very basic application regardless of
        which lesson you start with.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created these because there seemed to be lacking some more recent
        "walk through" Struts tutorials geared toward the very new Struts
        developer. I think real newbies will find them especially useful, but
        then again I could be way wrong:)
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm considering the site a "beta" because I'm sure there will be some
        mistakes. If anyone sees something I'm doing in a lesson that is way
        off (or a very bad practice) please let me know. Some of the stuff I
        know could be done in a more "best practice" way, but for the sake of
        trying to also keep the lessons small and simple some ideas weren't
        included (ie- I didn't use a constants interface for my forward
        definitions).
    </p>
    <p>
        If anyone wants to contribute, reword, or add anything please let me
        know. The site is there to help others. I got really lazy in a lot of
        places and didn't say much about certain things that I would have liked
        to. Hopefully over time the site will improve.

    <h3><a name="20030223.1"></a>23 Feb 2003 - New Nested Tags -or- Nesters, lend me your containers</h3>
    <pre>
        Avid Nesters,
        (you know who you are,
            no need to lie to yourself)
    </pre>
    <p>
        Tomcat 4.1.18 is now on the radar!...
    </p>
    <p>
        The nested tags internals have been re-written primarily to fix the problem
        with them not working in the new tomcat 4.1.18 jasper engine. It also allows
        them to be a little more flexible (can define other tags in the nesting), but
        more on that later...
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, I need to know that they work on all your current nested apps which
        are working. I've run my own tests, but according to feedback, some of you
        guys have a different take on using the nested tags than I do, so I need your
        help.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's also important for those of you using other containers, possibly never
        intending to use tomcat, to try them out, as it is intended to get merged into
        the Struts main line as soon as possible to help out those with the "can only
        use released product woes", or just trying to get onto a faster JSP engine
        that's free (gotta love the economics, but the new jasper engine does move.
        The recursive tree app example now hums along akin to the speed of Resin. sweet).
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the new classes, there's a jar at...
    </p>
    <p>
            <a href="http://www.keyboardmonkey.com/downloads/km-nested-v2.jar">
                http://www.keyboardmonkey.com/downloads/km-nested-v2.jar</a>
    </p>
    <p>
          ...just throw it into the WEB-INF/lib directory, your classloader should
        pick them up before struts.jar. If not, delete the tags from struts.jar and
        give it another bash.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, I'm really seeking your feedback on this update (email direct or to
        the list, I'm not fussed). The source is in the Jar if you want to simply say
        my code's badly formatted (which it isn't, but anyways :P )...
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks again, and happy nesting.

    <h3><a name="20030216"></a>16 Feb 2003 - Struts talks at Lone Star</h3>
    <p>
        The Lone Star Software Symposium in Austin TX February 21-23 features Struts presentations by
        Ted Husted as well as XDoclet presentations by Erik Hatcher.
        Erik is the originator of the popular LookupDispatchAction
        and has pioneered using XDoclet to create Struts ActionForms and other components.
    </p>
    <p>
        For details about the symposium, visit <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ted's "Building applications ... with Struts!" talk is Friday at 1:15pm:
    </p>
    <p>
        "What is this web presentation tier framework that has gained such widespread popularity?
        Struts, a Jakarta Model-View-Controller framework,
        allows clean separation between business logic and its presentation.
        This session will introduce Struts to those new to it or want a refresher on the basics.
        An example application will be built during the presentation demonstrating the primary features discussed."
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunday morning, Ted will be hosting a "More About Struts" talk:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Simple sites are simple to build in Struts. But most of our projects are complex, not simple.
        This session delves beyond the basics, into areas such as the Struts Validator, Struts TestCase,
        the Scaffold toolkit, and how to design the business-logic end of your application."
    </p>
    <p>
        Erik's XDoclet presentations are not Struts-specific,
        but would be interest to any Struts practitioner.
        (You can bet that Ted will be sitting in!)
        Erik's "Introduction to XDoclet" and "eXtreme XDoclet" talks are on Sunday Feb 23.
        Erik is also presenting talks on Lucene and Ant at the symposium.

        [Side note:  As you may know, Version 4 of Expresso incorporated Struts for its
        MVC patterns and since then we have never looked back!
        Great job to the Struts development team!!!
        We will probably have Struts 1.1 integrated by the next .1 release (5.1)]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Expresso development team would like to announce the release of Expresso 5.0.3.
        Changes in this release include the introduction of the JSTL tag library and
        changes to allow full compatibility with JSTL's expression language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bugfixes of note include better support for JNDI connections, initialization race
        condition fixes in the DBObject,
        and a SQL Injection fix in DBObject.searchAndRetrieve(String).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the last reason, it is recommended that all Expresso 5.0 users upgrade to 5.0.3 as soon as possible.

    <h3><a name="20030205"></a>05 Feb 2003 - Live Internet based Intermediate Struts Training by "Best Training"
        as voted by Java Developers Journal.</h3>

    <p>
    Live Internet based Intermediate Struts Training by "Best Training" as voted
    by Java Developers Journal. Learn good (best?) practices of web application
    development!
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Multi row processing to DB
    </li>
    <li>
    Master/Detail processing
    </li>
    <li>
    Java Script Navigation
    </li>
    <li>
    and lots more, full agenda available, and it's all practical, no theory from me!
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The title of the class is "Pretenders vs. Pros" used to be Best and Worst
    Practices. This is version 3 of my intermediate advanced class.
    </p>

    <p>
    The class will meet online over 4 weeks, Saturdays at 10 AM Eastern on WebEx for
    about an hour or a bit more or less. My goal is to start on the 2/22.
    </p>

    <p>
    You should have a DSL or Cable connection, ( not sure how modem will work,
    Web Ex says yeah, I say nay. Maybe you can go to work on Saturday?), and the
    call in on a phone # to hear voice
    </p>

    <p>
    You will have a mail list and newsgroup to ask questions on, I expect a lot
    of questions on the labs.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is NOT a intro to MVC, it is suitable for people that did one
    Struts/MVC project or are very familiar with Servelts/JDBC/JSP/SQL. If you
    are a Struts experienced, this is the class for you! If you are new to Java
    / Web, this is not class for you. It help if you have production web/mvc
    experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is NOT for hands off types, it is lab based, for each hour of lecture,
    there is at least 8 hours of labs each week. I promise the labs will be
    challenging.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you can't or don't do the web labs, the next lesson will make no sense to
    you. Not doing "home work" labs, you will be invited not to attend the rest.
    I want to avoid pretenders, and nurturer pros.
    </p>

    <p>
    Scared?  The labs are doable. Clients like BEA, Borland, Cisco, IBM, etc.
    already did the hand on in person labs. That is how baseBeans.com got voted
    for "Best Training" by Java Developers Journal. I am willing to put it on
    the line! by teaching the class over the web via WebEx.com.  I really want
    to be the teach of the year next year as well!
    </p>

    <p>
    I also did Struts project recovery, and worked on 40,000 concurrent users
    Struts site, I guess I did more Struts training than all others combined,
    plus more.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am certified OO instructor, certified SQL performance and Tuning, J2EE
    certified and Java Certified by 3 different J2EE vendors! You will enjoy the
    class and learn, guranteed.
    </p>

    <p>
    You charges will be mostly for the WebEx + voice, so you can see my screen.
    When you register early, you will get a CD mailed to you with the lab
    materials. (International clients will have another way)
    </p>

    <p>
    If you register earlier, you get a cheaper price, goes up every few days,
    just like for seminars, the later your register, the more you pay.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the cost is low, you can only register via the web, no P.O. or checks.

    <h3><a name="20031701"></a>17 Jan 2003 - JSP taglibs + FreeMarker</h3>
    <p>
        The new 2.2 version of the FreeMarker template engine now natively supports JSP tag libraries.
        The first preview release of the new version is downloadable from the project home page at
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net">http://freemarker.sourceforge.net</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This new ability is of special significance to Jakarta Struts and Taglib
        communities, since you are no longer forced into a tradeoff. Before now, you
        had to make a choice: either you couldn't use a template engine, or you
        couldn't use the taglibs. With FreeMarker, you no longer need to abandon any
        of the valuable taglibs you came to know and love if you want to change your
        view technology from JSP to a template engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aside from the native JSP taglib support, FreeMarker 2.2 introduces many new
        improvements in areas of macro handling, namespaces, automatic escaping of
        interpolations and whitespace handling.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="20030106"></a>06 Jan 2003 - neteye actioncache 1.1</h3>
    <p>
        The neteye actioncache is a Struts extension that caches the result of
        actions and views. It can boost the performance of your website because
        time expensive operations like data retrieval, JSP processing or XSLT
        transformations are only performed when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new release now uses the Struts 1.1 Plugin and RequestProcessor
        interfaces to handle request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sources and documentation can be found at
        <a href="http://actioncache.neteye.de">http://actioncache.neteye.de</a>

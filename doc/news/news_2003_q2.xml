     <h4 id="S20030624">24 Jun 2003 - JPlates 2.1 is available - great
     alternative to JSP for Struts</h4>
 
     <p>I know you're all busy with your current projects, but maybe the next
        one will be much easier if you use JPlates. </p>
     <p>JPlates 2.1 is now available for licensed use and evaluation. JPlates
        is a fully object-oriented template-processing system that combines
        many of
        the best features of Java with great template processing features to
        create
        a terrific alternate to JSP for use    with Struts. </p>
     <p>JPlates generates true JVM classes that are seamlessly compatible with
        Java, and every JPlates method is an executable template. What that
        means is
        that you can build your MVC views using objects and classes and methods
        (and
        not includes), just    like you build everything else. </p>
     <p>Take a look at
        <a href="http://www.jplates.com/">http://www.jplates.com/</a>,
        and please follow the link on the left side to the note about JSP
        scriptlets. </p>

     <p>I know this list contains a wealth of production minded talent. So, I
        wanted to let everyone know that eclipse.org has begun discussions on a
        new
        project to create a webtools platform for developing J2EE projects
        under the
        Eclipse IDE. It is currently open to discussion on the webtools list.
        So, if
        you want to donate    some talent and/or ideas ... go to
        <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/index.html">

     <h4 id="S20030608">08 Jun 2003 - Wildcard-Matched    Actions</h4>
     <p>This project allows wildcards to be used in Struts 1.1+ action
     mappings.
        The wildcard-matched values can then be substituted in the values of
        various
        Struts action mapping and action forward attributes. It uses the
        wildcard matching
        class from Apache Cocoon which is the default matching class used to
        match
        XML transformation pipelines.</p>
     <p>The bottom line of this project is you can write generic actions that
        can be used to match multiple actions. Even the "type" attribute which
        specifies the Action class can have wildcard-matched values
        substituted to match multiple Action classes for one action mapping. It
        also
        works great for Struts applications that use DispatchActions or other
        generic
        Actions. </p>
     <p>For example:</p>
 <pre><code>
               &lt;action    path="/edit*"
                          type="org.twdata.struts.ScriptAction"
                     attribute="{1}Form"
                         scope="request"
                      validate="false"
                     parameter="/WEB-INF/scripts/Edit{1}.bsh"&gt;
 
                   &lt;forward name="failure" path="/mainMenu.jsp"/&gt;
                   &lt;forward name="success" path="/{1}.jsp"/&gt;
               &lt;/action&gt;
 </code></pre>

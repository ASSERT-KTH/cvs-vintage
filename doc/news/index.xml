        <h4 id="a20031110">10 Nov 2003 - JUnit in Action now Available </h4>
        <p>
            A new book offering, JUnit in Action, by Jakarta regulars Vincent Massol and Ted Husted, is now available for purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy - unit testing - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way. This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using the popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It's a no fluff discussion of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications, and shows how to test in automated builds.
            What's Inside
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
Testing in isolation with mock objects
            </li>
            <li>
                In-container testing with Cactus

                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            While the book does not cover Struts-only testing, the techniques taught here are applicable to any web application.

        <h4 id="a20031105">05 Nov 2003 - Visual Tags for Struts 2004 Released</h4>
        <p>
        FWA Software, Inc released Visual Tags for Struts 2004 on 03 November 2003.
        Visual Tags for Struts 2004 is the latest release of FWA Software's
        extension suite that integrates the Struts 1.1 tag libraries with
        Dreamweaver.  The major new feature in Visual Tags for Struts 2004 is
        support for modular installation of the six Struts tag libraries, providing
        web developers the capability to install only the tag library extensions
        they need.
        </p>
        <p>
        Visual Tags for Struts is the first commercial product to fully integrate
        the Jakarta-Struts 1.1 custom JSP tags with Dreamweaver MX.  Visual Tags for
        Struts enables web developers to use Dreamweaver to create and maintain web
        pages for Struts-based web applications using both visual layout and editing
        and text-based editing of JSP pages containing Struts custom tags.
        </p>
        <p>
        FWA Software also released a new version of Visual Tags for Struts -
        Designer Edition.  This version includes enhancements for upward
        compatibility with Dreamweaver MX 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
        Visual Tags for Struts is available for Dreamweaver MX on Windows.
        Full-function evaluation versions of the products are available for
        immediate download from FWA Software's web site
        (<a href="http://www.fwasi.com/products">http://www.fwasi.com/products</a>).

        <h4 id="a20031101">01 Nov 2003 - Web Application Architecture: Principles, Protocols and Practices</h4>
        <p>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471486566/neurozen">Web Application Architecture: Principles, Protocols and Practices</a>, a new book by Leon Shklar and Rich Rosen, has just been published by John Wiley &amp; Sons. It has been released in Europe, and will be generally available in the US in December 2003. It is intended both as a textbook for advanced web development classes (such as the one taught by Dr. Shklar at Rutgers University), and as a reference for software developers and architects.
        </p>
        <p>
        The book covers:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        Internet protocols in general,
        </li>
        <li>
        HTTP in particular,
        </li>
        <li>
        Web server and browser architecture,
        </li>
        <li>
        Markup languages from SGML through XML, and
        </li>
        <li>
        Web application development frameworks from CGI to J2EE.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The authors describe and encourage best practices for web application design, advocating the use of <b>MVC</b> approaches, and offering up their own sample application -- a multiple-listing-services web site for real estate brokers. They explain their rationale for choosing <b>Struts</b> as their development platform, discuss the issues associated with building a sophisticated web application, and walk through the process of designing and implementing this application using <b>Struts</b> and <b>JSTL</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The application source code is available on the authors' web site at <a href="http://www.WebAppBuilders.com">http://www.WebAppBuilders.com</a>, including instructions for building and deploying the application on Tomcat with a MySQL database system. For instructors wishing to use this as a course textbook, there are questions and exercises at the end of each chapter, including suggested enhancements that can be made to the sample application.
        </p>
        <p>
        The book also provides extensive coverage of emerging technologies like Web Services and RDF.

        <h4 id="a20031023">23 Oct 2003 - Struts IRC Channel: Quick, easy relief</h4>
        <p>
            The struts IRC channel at <code>irc.darkmyst.org #struts_users</code> was created
            for two reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
            1) To provide a place where struts questions can receive more
            interactive and immediate dialog.
        </p>
        <p>
            2) To relieve [OT] tensions from the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please feel free to visit the IRC channel to participate in either. It
            is good practice to keep the struts list clean from renegade threads.
        </p>

            The next meeting of the Silicon Valley Struts User BOF will be held at
            Netscape in Mountain View on Wednesday, November 5th. Craig McClanahan, a
            senior staff engineer for Sun Microsystems, will make a presentation on this
            topic:
        </p>
        <p>
            Struts and JavaServer Faces -- Competition or Coexistence?
        </p>
        <p>
            Craig is uniquely qualified to give this talk, because he is both the
            original creator of the Struts Framework and co-specification lead for
            JavaServer Faces (JSR-127). You will find the full announcement including

        <h4 id="a20031020">20 Oct 2003 - Struts Message Resource Doc</h4>
        <p>
            A short article detailing usage of the message resources functionality with Struts
            is avialable.  It seems like a lot of people are having problems with it, and this
            article may shed some light on this topic.
         </p>

        <h4 id="a20031017">17 Oct 2003 - Spring Framework Integration Library for Struts</h4>
        <p>
            This project integrates the Spring Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC)
            into Struts 1.1+. It allows a Struts application to take advantage of IoC
            with little or no references to Spring. Now, instead of relying on
            singletons and static factories, Struts actions can have their
            dependencies automatically resolved.
        </p>

        <p>
            The integration uses Spring to create and populate Struts actions, using
            IoC to resolve dependencies. It does NOT use a custom request processor
            and therefore can be more easily used with existing web applications
            and/or other Struts extensions.
        </p>

        <p>
            To demonstrate the project, I modified the Struts-Example web app that is
            distributed with Struts 1.1 to use Spring to resolve all UserDatabase
            dependencies automatically. I invite any comments and suggestions.

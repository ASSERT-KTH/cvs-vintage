Download counts for Struts binary distributions in October 2002:
</p>

<pre>
  1.0.2:          15,780
  1.1-b1:            763
  1.1-b2:          9,695
  Nightlies:       2,961
                  ------
  Total:          29,199
                  ======
</pre>

<p>
or around 940 per day. That's second highest among Jakarta projects,
the highest being Tomcat with 80k-100k downloads per month.
</p>

<p>
These counts reflect only the main Apache website -- they don't count
any downloads from Apache mirrors, or from other sites that support
download of the Struts binaries, either by themselves or incorporated in
other tools. (The Apache Software License is wonderful for developers,
but terrible for bean counters ...)
</p>

<p>
As of November 14, the subscription counts to the Struts user mailing
lists (counting digest subscribers) is:
</p>

<pre>
  STRUTS-USER:     2,399
</pre>

<p>
which only just trails Tomcat:
</p>

<pre>
  TOMCAT-USER:     2,454

    <h3><a name="20030206.1"></a>06 Feb 2003 - Expresso 5.0.3 Available for Download</h3>
    <p>
        [Side note:  As you may know, Version 4 of Expresso incorporated Struts for its
        MVC patterns and since then we have never looked back!
        Great job to the Struts development team!!!
        We will probably have Struts 1.1 integrated by the next .1 release (5.1)]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Expresso development team would like to announce the release of Expresso 5.0.3.
        Changes in this release include the introduction of the JSTL tag library and
        changes to allow full compatibility with JSTL's expression language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bugfixes of note include better support for JNDI connections, initialization race
        condition fixes in the DBObject,
        and a SQL Injection fix in DBObject.searchAndRetrieve(String).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the last reason, it is recommended that all Expresso 5.0 users upgrade to 5.0.3 as soon as possible.

    <h3><a name="20030205"></a>05 Feb 2003 - Live Internet based Intermediate Struts Training by "Best Training"
        as voted by Java Developers Journal.</h3>

    <p>
    Live Internet based Intermediate Struts Training by "Best Training" as voted
    by Java Developers Journal. Learn good (best?) practices of web application
    development!
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Multi row processing to DB
    </li>
    <li>
    Master/Detail processing
    </li>
    <li>
    Java Script Navigation
    </li>
    <li>
    and lots more, full agenda available, and it's all practical, no theory from me!
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The title of the class is "Pretenders vs. Pros" used to be Best and Worst
    Practices. This is version 3 of my intermediate advanced class.
    </p>

    <p>
    The class will meet online over 4 weeks, Saturdays at 10 AM Eastern on WebEx for
    about an hour or a bit more or less. My goal is to start on the 2/22.
    </p>

    <p>
    You should have a DSL or Cable connection, ( not sure how modem will work,
    Web Ex says yeah, I say nay. Maybe you can go to work on Saturday?), and the
    call in on a phone # to hear voice
    </p>

    <p>
    You will have a mail list and newsgroup to ask questions on, I expect a lot
    of questions on the labs.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is NOT a intro to MVC, it is suitable for people that did one
    Struts/MVC project or are very familiar with Servelts/JDBC/JSP/SQL. If you
    are a Struts experienced, this is the class for you! If you are new to Java
    / Web, this is not class for you. It help if you have production web/mvc
    experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is NOT for hands off types, it is lab based, for each hour of lecture,
    there is at least 8 hours of labs each week. I promise the labs will be
    challenging.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you can't or don't do the web labs, the next lesson will make no sense to
    you. Not doing "home work" labs, you will be invited not to attend the rest.
    I want to avoid pretenders, and nurturer pros.
    </p>

    <p>
    Scared?  The labs are doable. Clients like BEA, Borland, Cisco, IBM, etc.
    already did the hand on in person labs. That is how baseBeans.com got voted
    for "Best Training" by Java Developers Journal. I am willing to put it on
    the line! by teaching the class over the web via WebEx.com.  I really want
    to be the teach of the year next year as well!
    </p>

    <p>
    I also did Struts project recovery, and worked on 40,000 concurrent users
    Struts site, I guess I did more Struts training than all others combined,
    plus more.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am certified OO instructor, certified SQL performance and Tuning, J2EE
    certified and Java Certified by 3 different J2EE vendors! You will enjoy the
    class and learn, guranteed.
    </p>

    <p>
    You charges will be mostly for the WebEx + voice, so you can see my screen.
    When you register early, you will get a CD mailed to you with the lab
    materials. (International clients will have another way)
    </p>

    <p>
    If you register earlier, you get a cheaper price, goes up every few days,
    just like for seminars, the later your register, the more you pay.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the cost is low, you can only register via the web, no P.O. or checks.
    </p>

    questions later, etc. sign up at

    <p>
        More than forty developers have contributed code or documentation to Struts.
        We've tried to list all of our volunteers on the <a href="../volunteers.html">Who We Are</a> page
        (and apologize to anyone we missed!).
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the release of Struts 1.1 RC1 (20/Feb/2003) through 30/May/2003,
        there were 741 commit events to the Struts CVS
        (which may have affected multiple files).
    </p>

    <p>
       On 30/May/2003, the mailing list counts were:
    </p>

    <pre>
  User    1929
  Digest   806
  Dev      740
        ------
  Total   3475
        ======
    </pre>

<p>
In October 2002, the download counts for Struts binary distributions were:
</p>

<pre>
  1.0.2:          15,780
  1.1-b1:            763
  1.1-b2:          9,695
  Nightlies:       2,961
                  ------
  Total:          29,199
                  ======
</pre>

<p>
or around 940 per day. That's second highest among Jakarta projects,
the highest being Tomcat with 80k-100k downloads per month.
</p>

<p>
These counts reflect only the main Apache website -- they don't count
any downloads from Apache mirrors, or from other sites that support
download of the Struts binaries, either by themselves or incorporated in
other tools. (The Apache Software License is wonderful for developers,
but terrible for bean counters ...)
</p>

<p>
As of November 14, the subscription counts to the Struts user mailing
lists (counting digest subscribers) is:
</p>

<pre>
  STRUTS-USER:     2,399
</pre>

<p>
which only just trails Tomcat:
</p>

<pre>
  TOMCAT-USER:     2,454

    <h3><a name="20030318"></a>18 Mar 2003 - Struts-Faces Integration Library Available</h3>

    <p>
      The <em>Struts-Faces Integration Library</em> is an add-on library
      that supports the use of
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">JavaServer Faces</a>
      user interface technology in a Struts-based web application, in place of
      the Struts custom tag libraries.  As a proof of concept, it also
      includes the canonical "struts-example" example web application,
      converted to use JavaServer Faces Tags, as well as tags from the JSP
      Standard Tag Library (JSTL), version 1.0.
    </p>

    <p>
      The source code for this library is in the
      <code>contrib/struts-faces</code> directory of the Struts CVS repository,
      and nightly builds are available at:
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly/struts-faces/">
        http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly/struts-faces/</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This library is EA quality code, and is not going to be integrated into
      standard Struts releases until it has matured further, and until
      JavaServer Faces goes to 1.0 final release status.  The library requires
      a Struts 1.1 nightly build (20030216 or later), or the upcoming 1.1 RC2
      or 1.1 final releases.  It also requires the EA3 version of the
      JavaServer Faces reference implementation, available via:
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/download.html">
      http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/download.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Struts-Faces integration download includes source code for the
      library (useful to see how the integration was accomplished, and also
      to learn how to build custom JavaServer Faces component and renderer
      classes), as well as an extensive <code>README.txt</code> that documents
      how to utilize the library in your own applications.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="20030217"></a>17 Feb 2003 - Struts talk .. &amp; labs live online w/ 4 Authors</h3>
    <p>
        Ted &amp; James have now both graciously agreed to join the WebEx labs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try to see them in person! <br />
        (I just did DC 2 weeks ago).
    </p>
    <p>
        This in addition to doing real labs for multi row master detail processing to DB, etc.
        I just added extra sessions.
        You can find out more and how to sign up at
        <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/mvc-programmers%40basebeans.net/msg00006.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/mvc-programmers%40basebeans.net/msg00006.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        But if you can't ... you can see their presentation and hear them live from your home or work,
        shortly after their live shows.
    </p>
    <p>
        The qualifier is that this is not intro to Struts
        and that you please do the hands on labs after each of the 5 sessions.

    <h3><a name="20030216"></a>16 Feb 2003 - Struts talks at Lone Star</h3>
    <p>
        The Lone Star Software Symposium in Austin TX February 21-23 features Struts presentations by
        Ted Husted as well as XDoclet presentations by Erik Hatcher.
        Erik is the originator of the popular LookupDispatchAction
        and has pioneered using XDoclet to create Struts ActionForms and other components.
    </p>
    <p>
        For details about the symposium, visit <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ted's "Building applications ... with Struts!" talk is Friday at 1:15pm:
    </p>
    <p>
        "What is this web presentation tier framework that has gained such widespread popularity?
        Struts, a Jakarta Model-View-Controller framework,
        allows clean separation between business logic and its presentation.
        This session will introduce Struts to those new to it or want a refresher on the basics.
        An example application will be built during the presentation demonstrating the primary features discussed."
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunday morning, Ted will be hosting a "More About Struts" talk:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Simple sites are simple to build in Struts. But most of our projects are complex, not simple.
        This session delves beyond the basics, into areas such as the Struts Validator, Struts TestCase,
        the Scaffold toolkit, and how to design the business-logic end of your application."
    </p>
    <p>
        Erik's XDoclet presentations are not Struts-specific,
        but would be interest to any Struts practitioner.
        (You can bet that Ted will be sitting in!)
        Erik's "Introduction to XDoclet" and "eXtreme XDoclet" talks are on Sunday Feb 23.
        Erik is also presenting talks on Lucene and Ant at the symposium.

    <h3><a name="20030215"></a>15 Feb 2003 - Struts quiz online at java.sun.com</h3>
    <p>
        As part of an ongoing series, a Struts Quiz is available at the java.sun.com website
        <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/Quizzes/misc.html">http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/Quizzes/misc.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The quiz was written by Ted Husted, Struts Committer and lead author of Struts in Action.
        The SIA quiz joins other recent Java quizzes on the topics of Ant and JMX.
        The Struts questions are designed to point out some useful but underutilized aspects of the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, pop over and have a bit of fun testing your Struts knowledge,
        and maybe even learn something at the same time. =:0)

    <h3><a name="20030206.1"></a>06 Feb 2003 - Expresso 5.0.3 Available for Download</h3>
    <p>
        [Side note:  As you may know, Version 4 of Expresso incorporated Struts for its
        MVC patterns and since then we have never looked back!
        Great job to the Struts development team!!!
        We will probably have Struts 1.1 integrated by the next .1 release (5.1)]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Expresso development team would like to announce the release of Expresso 5.0.3.
        Changes in this release include the introduction of the JSTL tag library and
        changes to allow full compatibility with JSTL's expression language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bugfixes of note include better support for JNDI connections, initialization race
        condition fixes in the DBObject,
        and a SQL Injection fix in DBObject.searchAndRetrieve(String).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the last reason, it is recommended that all Expresso 5.0 users upgrade to 5.0.3 as soon as possible.

    <h3><a name="20030205"></a>05 Feb 2003 - Live Internet based Intermediate Struts Training by "Best Training"
        as voted by Java Developers Journal.</h3>

    <p>
    Live Internet based Intermediate Struts Training by "Best Training" as voted
    by Java Developers Journal. Learn good (best?) practices of web application
    development!
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Multi row processing to DB
    </li>
    <li>
    Master/Detail processing
    </li>
    <li>
    Java Script Navigation
    </li>
    <li>
    and lots more, full agenda available, and it's all practical, no theory from me!
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The title of the class is "Pretenders vs. Pros" used to be Best and Worst
    Practices. This is version 3 of my intermediate advanced class.
    </p>

    <p>
    The class will meet online over 4 weeks, Saturdays at 10 AM Eastern on WebEx for
    about an hour or a bit more or less. My goal is to start on the 2/22.
    </p>

    <p>
    You should have a DSL or Cable connection, ( not sure how modem will work,
    Web Ex says yeah, I say nay. Maybe you can go to work on Saturday?), and the
    call in on a phone # to hear voice
    </p>

    <p>
    You will have a mail list and newsgroup to ask questions on, I expect a lot
    of questions on the labs.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is NOT a intro to MVC, it is suitable for people that did one
    Struts/MVC project or are very familiar with Servelts/JDBC/JSP/SQL. If you
    are a Struts experienced, this is the class for you! If you are new to Java
    / Web, this is not class for you. It help if you have production web/mvc
    experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is NOT for hands off types, it is lab based, for each hour of lecture,
    there is at least 8 hours of labs each week. I promise the labs will be
    challenging.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you can't or don't do the web labs, the next lesson will make no sense to
    you. Not doing "home work" labs, you will be invited not to attend the rest.
    I want to avoid pretenders, and nurturer pros.
    </p>

    <p>
    Scared?  The labs are doable. Clients like BEA, Borland, Cisco, IBM, etc.
    already did the hand on in person labs. That is how baseBeans.com got voted
    for "Best Training" by Java Developers Journal. I am willing to put it on
    the line! by teaching the class over the web via WebEx.com.  I really want
    to be the teach of the year next year as well!
    </p>

    <p>
    I also did Struts project recovery, and worked on 40,000 concurrent users
    Struts site, I guess I did more Struts training than all others combined,
    plus more.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am certified OO instructor, certified SQL performance and Tuning, J2EE
    certified and Java Certified by 3 different J2EE vendors! You will enjoy the
    class and learn, guranteed.
    </p>

    <p>
    You charges will be mostly for the WebEx + voice, so you can see my screen.
    When you register early, you will get a CD mailed to you with the lab
    materials. (International clients will have another way)
    </p>

    <p>
    If you register earlier, you get a cheaper price, goes up every few days,
    just like for seminars, the later your register, the more you pay.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the cost is low, you can only register via the web, no P.O. or checks.

        had to make a choice: either you couldn't use a template engine, or you
        couldn't use the taglibs. With FreeMarker, you no longer need to abandon any
        of the valuable taglibs you came to know and love if you want to change your
        view technology from JSP to a template engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aside from the native JSP taglib support, FreeMarker 2.2 introduces many new
        improvements in areas of macro handling, namespaces, automatic escaping of
        interpolations and whitespace handling.

        Now we are working on setup.exe (currently in beta but available) that will install DB,
        Tomcat (because people do not know how to set up JDBC realms in server.xml).

        JDBC realms, BLOBs, CRUD,  JMeter, JaserReports, etc.
        Just e-mail me if you know Struts and want to contribute to open source.

    <p>
    #2. Bring a laptop to public training in DC/NYC training to get *FREE* autographed "Struts in Action".

    <h3><a name="20030106"></a>06 Jan 2003 - neteye actioncache 1.1</h3>
    <p>
        The neteye actioncache is a Struts extension that caches the result of
        actions and views. It can boost the performance of your website because
        time expensive operations like data retrieval, JSP processing or XSLT
        transformations are only performed when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new release now uses the Struts 1.1 Plugin and RequestProcessor
        interfaces to handle request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sources and documentation can be found at
        <a href="http://actioncache.neteye.de">http://actioncache.neteye.de</a>

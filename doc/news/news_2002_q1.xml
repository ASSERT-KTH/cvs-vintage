<h3><a name="20020304"></a>04 March 2002 - Best Practice with Expresso-Struts Framework</h3>
<p>
In this article, Peter Pilgrim looks at the best practice of using a popular web
application toolkit, The Expresso Framework. The Expresso Framework, until version 3, had its
own Model View Controller engine. It now  integrates Struts, further reducing the amount of
code that developers need to write. As well as having an  MVC framework, Struts also has its
own powerful custom tag actions. Custom tag libraries and their powerful bean introspection
core further reduce the total amount of Java scriptlets in Java Server Pages."

<h3><a name="20020301"></a>01 March 2002 - Simper 0.2</h3>
<p>
Simper is a simple JDBC persistence mechanism for Java web apps. It
features many of the interesting features of EJB, such as automatic
transaction demarcation (by way of Servlet Filters), and automatic
change detection of database rows (by way of DynaBeans). Lastly, the
notation by which you reference rows, as well as relations between
tables, is extremely JSP friendly.
</p>

</p>
<p>
0.2 is not a new release (it's been out for about a month), but, a
SourceForge project has been set up, with mailing lists, CVS, etc., so
that others can discuss and contribute (as I am getting quite busy
lately)

<h3><a name="20020228.3"></a>28 February 2002 - Struts Whitepaper</h3>
<p>
I've been collecting, in a document, Struts examples 
and know how while I have been learning Struts.  I 
have decided to make this available to everyone in 
a white paper.
</p>
<p>
It's available on my companies web-site at:<br/>
<a href="http://stealthis.athensgroup.com/presentations/">
http://stealthis.athensgroup.com/presentations/
</a>
</p>
<p>
It's under the Model_Layer_Framework heading.  The
link to the paper is called Struts_Whitepaper.doc
(it's a word document.)
</p>
<p>
I hope others will find this to be useful.

<h3><a name="20020228.2"></a>28 February 2002 - Struts Workflow Extension Package</h3>
<p>
To all struts users!
</p>
<p>
It has been quite some time since I first announced the Struts Workflow
Extension Package. Since then, I have received several requests for an example
application and pretty good ideas for further enhancements. Here now is the 
first official release that includes an example application and most of the 
suggested enhancements.
</p>
<p>
I know that there is a proposal and already some work going on in the Jakarta
Commons Project for a generic workflow package that is not directly based on 
Struts, but should be easily integratable. Unfortunately this work is not 
progressing as quickly as some struts user would like to see. Thus, if you have 
a need (and in each Web-Application you normally have) for workflow control, try 
this extension and check whether it is appropriate for you.
</p>

sources, visit

<h3><a name="20020228"></a>28 February 2002 - Tutorial for implementing i18n</h3>

working with Struts.

I welcome any comments, as I intend on improving it where necessary.

<h3><a name="20020223"></a>23 February 2002 - New Plugin mechanism</h3>
<p>
A new lightweight PlugIn mechanism is now available in the nightly build.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/struts-dev%40jakarta.apache.org/msg05002.html">
http://www.mail-archive.com/struts-dev%40jakarta.apache.org/msg05002.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The PlugIn API is somewhat stripped down compared to the ServiceManager, so
it's possible that it won't meet your needs. The ServiceManager itself has
largely been moved to Jakarta Commons, and is currently in the sandbox:

<h3><a name="20020212"></a>12 February 2002 - Stxx for transforming XML</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.oroad.com/opencode/">
<b>Struts for transforming XML with XSL</b></a> (stxx) is an extension of 
the Struts framework to enhance support for XML and XSL.
</p>
<p>
stxx sits on top of Struts, extending it's existing functionality to allow
Action classes to return XML that will be transformed by an XSL file.
</p>
<p>
The idea of stxx is to remove the need to be use JSP and TagLibs for the
presentation layer of this framework. However, stxx does not force you to go the
XML/XSL route, both technologies should work side by side.
</p>
<p>
So, adding XSL support to struts is ALMOST as simple as adding the following
tags to your struts-config.xml file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;action path="/welcome"
        type="com.oroad.stxx.example.ExampleWelcomeAction"
        scope="request">
        &lt;forward name="success">
&lt;!-- 
    the transform tags take the XML returned by the Action
    and transform them. The transform tag used is determined
    by matching the user agent against the name attribute (or
    default if nothing matches)
-->
                &lt;transform name="default" path="/login.xsl"/>
                &lt;transform name="Mozilla" path="/login_netscape.xsl"/>
                &lt;transform name="MSIE" path="/login_msie.xsl"/>
        &lt;/forward>
&lt;/action>
</pre>
<p>
stxx features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enhances the &lt;forward> tag in the struts-config.xml file to allow
one to many &lt;transform> tags. These &lt;transform> tags represent 
the XSL file to be used depending on the user-agent of the 
browser accessing struts
</li><li>
A new class variable for the Action class, A JDOM Document, which 
you use to append your data in your Action class too. This 
Document object will be transformed by the XSL file in your 
&lt;transform> tag.
</li><li>
stxx automatically flattens the ApplicationResources file to XML 
and attaches it to the Document object returned by the new Action   
class.
</li><li>
stxx also automatically appends the request parameters and 
attributes, as well as ActionErrors as XML to the Document 
object.
</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Please note: stxx is a work in progress, however, at this point I've been using
it for about 4 months and it works great for me, I realize it might not fit
everyone elses needs. Please send me feedback, opinions, complains, etc.

<h3>26 January 2002 - Free Struts Development Tool</h3>
<p>
"ObjectAssembler Standard is focused on supporting developers whose sole
area of concern is developing Servlets, JSPs, JavaBeans and Struts
components. It provides a visual development and code synchronization
environment for the creation and assembly of these components into web
applications."
</p>
<p>
Here is the download page:<br/>
<a href="http://www.objectventure.com/products/objectassembler.html">

</p>
<p>
Here is a Viewlet showing some of ObjectAssembler's features:<br/>

</p>
<p>
Please give it a try and tell us what you think. We are currently working on
our next major release that will provide J2EE 1.3 support. We also plan to
support Struts as it evolves (multi-app support, etc.), so any input we
receive would make that support even better.

<h3><a name="20020118"></a>18 Jan 2002 - Nested Taglib added to nightly build</h3>
<p>
Struts tags support a dotted notation to refer to a nested beans. The Nested 
Talib extends this notation to automatically include a parent tag. Instead of 
referring to a property as parent<strong>.</strong>child, "parent" can be 
defined with the <code>nest</code> tag, and other Struts tags within that 
tag can simply refer to the "child" property. Tags can be nested arbitarily 
deep.

<h3>17 January 2002 - Chiki v0.23</h3>

Chiki is a Wiki-like webapp built using Struts. This is the first
publicly available release, so as much feedback as possible would be
greatly appreciated.

<h3>13 Janaury 2002 - Scioworks Camino v1.0</h3>

<h3><a name="20020112.2"></a>12 Jan 2002 - MultiApp Capability Added</h3>
<p>
Support for multiple application modules has been added to the nightly build. 
Developers can now provide multiple Struts configuration files, each of which 
can defines its own "module prefix". All of the "context-relative" values in 
the Struts configuration are now "module-relative". Struts components which '
handle context-relative URIs now transparently handle module-relative URIs. 
</p>
<p>
Existing configuration files, JavaServer Pages, or Actions do not need to be 
changed to use this capability. The only change is to specify the module 
prefix to be used with each additional configuration. 
</p>
<p>
This feature allows different teams to work on different parts of an 
application at the same time, without conflict over the configuration file. 
It also allows Struts applications that were developed independantly to be 
easily merged. 
</p>
<p>
Formal documentation is pending. See the Mailing List Archive for details.

<p>
<b>Path-based action mapping in 1.1</b><br/>
One of the architectural advances from Struts 1.0 to Struts 1.1 involved 
supporting multiple applications with a single Struts controller 
servlet.  As part of the initial implementation of this functionality, 
some configuration flexibility was lost: the multi-application 
controller only supports mapping URLs to Struts "actions" by extension 
(i.e. "*.do") while Struts 1.0 also supported mapping by path prefix 
(i.e. "/do/*").  After James Young asked if any fixes were in the works 
[1], Craig McClanahan pointed out some of the complexities involved 
[2].  Ted Husted described a possible solution and asked for feedback 
about whether to pursue it. [3]</p>

<p>
<b>Tiles add-in to moved to core</b><br/>
Craig McClanahan moved the "Tiles" add-in into the core CVS source tree 
from the "contrib" directory.[4] Ted Husted initiated a discussion about 
some code modifications to "Tiles" to make it work more closely with the 
core code base.[5]</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>FormBean: Interface or Class?</b><br/>
The discussion about whether the "FormBean" concept was best implemented 
as an interface or a class resurfaced, and Craig McClanahan wrote a 
decisive response explaining the motivation for maintaining it as a 
class.[6]  In summary, designing FormBean as an interface would 
facilitate inappropriate tangling of the "model" layer with the "view" 
layer, while making it a class of its own encourages clean separation of 
those layers.</p>

<p>
<b>Struts and the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL)</b><br/>
After announcing the 1.0 release of the JSTL, Shawn Bayern offered 
assistance towards integrating the rich Struts tag libraries with the 
JSTL, which in many cases offers equivalent functionality.[7]  Craig 
McClanahan indicated that a likely goal for a post 1.1 release of Struts 
would be thorough integration with the JSTL expression language, and 
aiming towards an eventual replacement of the Struts "bean" and "logic" 
tag libraries with the equivalent tags from JSTL.[8]</p>

<b>New Committer: James Holmes</b><br/>
James Holmes, author of the popular Struts Console tool, was proposed as 
a committer by Ted Husted [9] and was accepted unanimously.

<p>
<b>Steps towards Struts 1.1b2</b><br/>
As much of the activity on the list in June involved "swatting" bugs in 
the current 1.1b1 release, Craig McClanahan proposed steps towards a 
Struts 1.1b2 by around July 8th[10]  The requirements for the next beta 
are basically closing any remaining bugs and improving documentation of 
new Struts features. Committers responded  promptly with +1 votes and 
further contributions.

<h3><a name="20020612"></a>12 June 2002 - Artimus 0.4</h3>
<p>
An updated version of the Artimus example application is now available at:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.husted.com/struts/resources/artimus.zip">www.husted.com/struts/resources/artimus.zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
See the README.TXT to get started.
</p>
<p>
This application demonstrates some of the design strategies discussed on the list recently:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The business tier is represented by a set of "ProcessBeans", dispatched using the Command pattern.</li>
<li>A framework Action is used to dispatch the ProcessBeans. The bean type is specified using the parameter property. </li>
<li>The framework Action (ProcessAction) returns a data transfer object (ResultList), designed for use by the presentation layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other goodies include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL commands are stored in external properties files and can be changed without recompiling.</li>
<li>All SQL commands are processed through a pair of easy-to-use static methods.</li>
<li>ResultSets are automatically transferred to a collection of beans. </li>
<li>A connection pool adapter allows use of the Struts connection pool from the business tier (and I said it couldn't be done :o). Other pools (Poolman, Resin, et cetera) may be configured through the web.xml. </li>
<li>Lucene is used side-by-side with JDBC to provide better searching when appropriate. </li>
<li>A helper servlet is used to load custom resources so ActionServlet does not need to be subclassed. </li>
<li>Application settings can be configured through the web.xml or a properties file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of these come out of the updated Scaffold package that is bundled in this distribution. The versions of Artimus and Scaffold in the Apache-Struts CVS will be updated shortly.

<h3><a name="20020611.1"></a>11 June 2002 - Struts Builder v0.4 beta</h3>
<p>
The SourceForge project "RiverNorth" has released Struts Builder v0.4 beta.
</p>
<p>
"Struts Builder" is an Opensource tool (GPL license) originally developed 
for internal use to aid in development of Struts-based web applications 
(1.1 style). The standalone Swing application allows users to create from 
scratch and/or import existing Struts 1.x struts-config.xml files, modify 
them via a forms-based GUI and generate the shell code including JSP/HTML 
pages, web.xml, struts-config.xml and java source files for Actions and 
ActionForms classes required for an implementation. I'm currently working 
on transferring info from our internal bug tracking system to the source 
forge site.
</p>
<p>
Planned future enhancements include creating plugin versions for popular 
IDEs, XMI import/export for WebUML, and the addition of a purely visual 
component for visualizing/editing the application model.
</p>
<p>
The tool is available at: <a href="http://rivernorth.sourceforge.net">rivernorth.sourceforge.net</a>
</p>
<p>
This project is actively seeking feedback and contributors.

Chapter 7 - Struts View Components - Chapter 7 introduces the components that make up the view 
portion of the Struts framework.
The framework uses the view components to render dynamic content for the client. Based
primarily on JavaServer Pages, the components provide support for internationalized
applications, as well extensive support for user input acceptance, validation, and error handling,
all of which make it easier for the developer to focus on business requirements. This chapter
concludes the three-part discussion of how the Struts framework implements the MVC pattern.

<h3><a name="20020604"></a>04 Jun 2002 - FL Child Support Payments: Powered by Struts</h3>
<p>
"My boss gave me the OK to give the Struts User Group access to the
Struts-based application I'm working on.
</p>
<p>
"I recently finished a beta release of a Child Support Payment (CSE-PAY)
system for the state of Florida.  The system is a Struts-based webapp where
I use several Struts features -- as much Struts as I could figure for my
first Struts project.
</p>
<p>
"You can access the system at:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://test.myfloridacounty.com/cse-pay/">test.myfloridacounty.com/cse-pay/</a>
</p>
<p>
Login to the web server with:
</p>
<p>
User:  myflc<br/>
Pass:  myflc
</p>
<p>
"Once logged in you're welcome to experiment with the system as much as you
like, i.e. sign up a phony user, credit card (e.g. Visa 4111111111111111),
add casses, make payments, etc...
</p>
<p>
"I have not got the OK to release all the source as a bundle, yet.  But, I
can release snippets on a case-by-case basis -- that is, I can send the code
that implements some behavior you're interested in.  Hopefully I can release
the complete source, soon."

Chapter 5 - Struts Controller Components <br/>
The Struts framework uses a servlet to process incoming requests, however it relies on many
other components that are part of the controller domain, to help it carry out its
responsibilities. The Struts controller components have been briefly mentioned in previous
chapters, but it's time to take in-depth look at what components have responsibility for the
controller functionality in the framework. 
</p>
<p>
Chapter 6 - Struts Model Components <br/>
This chapter introduces the components that make up the model portion of a Struts
application. The model represents the business data for an application and should closely
resemble the real-world entities and business processes for the organization. We will explore
the roles and responsibilities of the model components within the Struts framework and focus on building an architecturally correct
implementation for the storefront application. Special attention will be given to using a persistence framework that can be easily and effortlessly
integrated into a Struts application.

<h3><a name="20020501"></a>01 May 2002 - stxx 0.9.5 is available</h3>
<p>
The latest update to stxx is available at<br/>
<a href="http://www.openroad.ca/opencode/">www.openroad.ca/opencode/</a>
</p>
<p>
The biggest change in this version is the ability to have your transform 
tags do xsl:fo transformations (for example to PDF or SVG).
</p>
<p>
There are also bug fixes and updates to the examples.
</p>
<p>
Struts for transforming XML with XSL (stxx) is an extension of the 
Struts framework to support XML and XSL without changing the 
functionality of Struts .
</p>
<p>
stxx sits on top of Struts, extending it's existing functionality to 
allow Action classes to return XML that will be transformed by an XSL file.
</p>
<p>
The idea of stxx is to remove the need to be use JSP and TagLibs for the 
presentation layer of this framework. However, stxx does not force you 
to go the XML/XSL route, both technologies work side by side.

<h3><a name="20020425"></a>25 Apr 2002 - O'Reilly Chapters 1 and 2</h3>
<p>
Chapters 1 and 2 of the upcoming Struts book by Chuck Cavaness are now available on 
The ServerSide for community review.

</p>
<p>
Chapter 1 - Introduction
This introduction chapter discusses some preliminary concepts such as MVC, Model 2, and the idea of a software framework. Although many
developers may understand some or all of the ideas presented here, the inclusion of the material is necessary to ensure all readers are starting
from the same place. The concepts presented in this chapter help to lay the foundation for the rest of the book. 
</p>
<p>
Chapter 2 - Inside the Web Tier
The Struts framework is based on the Java Servlet Technology and to a lesser extent, JavaServer Pages, and therefore is tightly coupled to a
web container. For Struts developers, understanding how the web container processes client requests is fundamental to having a deeper
understanding of the framework itself. This chapter illustrates the various components that are part of the web container and what each
component's responsibilities are.

<h3><a name="20020423.1"></a>23 Apr 2002 - Synthis Corporation announces support for the Apache Struts J2EE Architecture</h3>
<p>
Synthis Corporation is pleased to announce that Adalon, a next-generation functional design tool for modeling Internet
applications, now offers full support for the Struts framework, the leading open-source J2EE Web application architecture
from the Apache Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
Adalon provides a single, integrated environment to gather and track business requirements, visually model the process
foundations of an application, and generate complete functional design documentation and code frameworks for ANY target
software architecture, programming language, and development platform.
</p>
<p>
Here is what people are saying about Adalon and Struts: 
</p>
<blockquote>
"The hardest part of designing any application can be deciding what to build.  Adalon helps clients clearly define "the
what" and "the why" of an application, and the code generation templates give Struts developers a serious jumpstart on "the
how", helping us to build not only a great application, but also the right application." -- Ted Husted, 
Active contributor to the Jakarta-Struts framework.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"We have incorporated Adalon into our development process and are currently training our consultants on the product.  With
Adalon, our consultants now have a great tool to manage the process of developing custom Struts solutions, from initial
requirements gathering through to the delivery of implemented code." -- Dmitry Shugaev, Vice President of Technology, 
Computer Consulting Services Corporation (CCSC).
</blockquote>
<p>
Synthis is offering support for Struts in the Adalon Struts Community Edition, and the Adalon Developer Edition.  For more

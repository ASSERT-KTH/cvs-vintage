            StrutsDoc is an Ant task that generates JavaDoc-like documentation from

            From the Back Cover:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"The authors do a great job describing useful patterns for application architectures.
            The section on refactoring is worth the price of the entire book!"</em> <br />

        </p>
        <p>
            Developers often confuse learning the technology with learning to design with the technology.

            Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) technology.
        </p>

            The primary focus of the book is on patterns, best practices, design strategies, and proven solutions using
            the key J2EE technologies including JavaServer Pages (JSP), Servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and Java
            Message Service (JMS) APIs.

        <h4 id="a20030908">08 Aug 2003 - Netspread Carrier 2.0 b2 </h4>
        <p>
            A solid release of Netspread Carrier 2.0 b2 is available today.
            The Carrier client, a visual design environment on Internet, is
            tested with JRE 1.4.2 with performance surprising my VB
            friends.
        </p>
        <p>
           Enhancements include:
        </p>
        <p>
            1) A Form Token Facility is introduced to automatically protect
            every web form and every hyper link in application modules with
            no-cache turned on. The facility is completely hidden from
            the views of designers and can be turned on/off programmatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            2) The Carrier Developer's Guide is near completed in which
            the LocalizedDate class is examined in details. The four
            key attributes, input format, output format, format pattern
            (or a key to the localized pattern), and error key, are completely
            encapsulated in the class. Therefore designers only need to
            register this class in a form bean property descriptor with
            desired format pattern or its key in ONE place. I see other
            methodologies make the designers to register input format here,
            output format there, pattern in another configuration file...
            causing endless troubles just for a simple Date property.
            Now the problem is solved in the cleanest way. It is a
            complete i18n java.sql.Date property to my knowledge and
            it tells us almost any other complex properties could be
            designed this way. See it with composing screen shots at
            <a href="http://www.netspread.com/developer.html#FormBeanValidations">
            http://www.netspread.com/developer.html#FormBeanValidations</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carrier is designed to be used by sloppy users like many of
            us on the Struts lists. It doesn't tell you "How easy to write codes
            to do it", instead, it tells you "How easy to compose web
            forms to do it" with the capability of CRUD operations for hierarchical
            and/or tabular data entries. It also tells you "Where you put
            wrong things" in case configuration errors occur. It is a solid
            commercial grade product for you to enjoy, no suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you complain any parts of it, tell us. User experience is on
            top of the priority list. Do not forget to follow the 24 tips
            on Wheels and Struts when you play it

            The release will initially be given an Alpha status and made available through the Release Manager's home
            directory.
            Pursuant to a Majority Vote on the /commons-dev/ Mailing List, the release may be moved to the public
            release directory.
            The vote may also serve to reclassify the release to be of *Beta* or *General Availability* (GA) quality,
            as defined by the Apache HTTPD project.
            Subsequent votes may reclassify the release, either to promote it or to demote it, as need be.

        <h4 id="S20030828">28 Aug 2003 - ASF Protest Euopean Software Patentability Rule Changes</h4>
        <p>
            On September 1st the European Commission is going to vote a revised version of the European Patentability
            rules.
            The proposed revision contains a set of serious challenges to Open Source development since regulation
            regarding software patents will be broadly extended and might forbid independent development of innovative
            (Open Source and not) software-based solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The European Open Source community is very concerned about the upcoming new regulation and has organized a
            demo protest for August 27, asking Open Source supporting sites to change their home pages to let everyone
            know what is going on at the European Parliament.
            The Apache Software Foundation supports this initiative.
            To show its support, a protest announcement is being displayed on all top-level home pages from
            Aug 28 through Sep 1.

        <h4 id="S20030825">25 Aug 2003 - Model-driven Development for Struts/EJB</h4>
        <p>
        Alpharetta, GA - Metanology releases new Model-driven Development Environment (MDE) products
        </p>
        <p>
        Overview:<br />
        MDE is a full featured, model-driven development environment that includes a
        UML modeler and MetaProgramTM editor that integrates with a Java IDE.  MDE
        transforms a simple UML model of an application into the majority of the
        implementation by executing MetaPrograms. Applications are completed using
        traditional development techniques.
        MDE for EJB and MDE for J2EE enhance the company's existing MDE for Struts.
        MDE for EJB creates session beans, entity beans, message driven beans,
        business objects and value objects from simple UML models. MDE for J2EE
        enhances MDE for Struts and MDE for EJB by interfacing the Struts user
        interface to EJB services.
        </p>
        <p>
        Platform Independent Modeling Typical modeling techniques require a class
        for each element in the implementation resulting in complex models that are
        difficult to understand and maintain. MDE promotes modeling what the
        application does, not how it is built, making modeling fast, easy, and
        reusable across platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
        MetaPrograms A combination of Java and JSP-style syntax, MetaPrograms are
        easy to write, contain all the technical details of architecture, and create
        multiple files in the implementation from a single class in the model.
        MetaProgramming with MDE gives you complete control of how the model is
        turned into code.  Rather than writing all the code by hand, MetaProgramming
        let's you "write the code that writes the code."TM
        </p>
        <p>
        MDE Life Cycle Life cycle benefits are two fold. First, life cycle tools
        preserve your hand-written code from one generation to the next. Second,
        they replace existing MetaProgram generated code with updated MetaProgram
        code. Used to its fullest, MDE is ideal for iterative and incremental
        development methods, Agile and Extreme Programming.

        <p>
            There are often newbie requests asking how to deal with a database layer
            from Struts. Since there are so many ways this can be done,

        <p>
            I didn't really have the time to write up a full lesson like the others
            on the site, but I did provide some comments on a few of the components
            that deal directly with iBATIS http://www.ibatis.com/.(The iBATIS
            documentation is excellent and should be read first along side the
            application). I've looked at the way others have plugged into the
            database layer and happen to think the approach I demonstrate is simple
            yet also very flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a more powerful implementation the user should check out the
            awesome JPetStore application at
            <a href="http://www.ibatis.com/jpetstore/jpetstore.html">http://www.ibatis.com/jpetstore/jpetstore.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, Vic has an interesting approach using iBATIS demonstrated in
            the basicPortal application that you can check out
            here: <a href="http://www.basicportal.com/">http://www.basicportal.com/</a>

<section href="why" name="Why do we need Struts?">
<p>Java technologies give developers a serious boost when creating and maintaining applications to meet the demands of today's public Web sites and enterprise intranets. Struts combines Java Servlets, Java ServerPages, custom tags, and message resources into a unified framework. The end result is a cooperative, synergistic platform, suitable for development teams, independent developers, and everyone in between.</p>
</section>

<section href="how" name="How does Struts work?">
<p>Java Servlets are designed to handle requests made by Web browsers. Java ServerPages are designed to create dynamic Web pages that can turn billboard sites into live applications. Struts uses a special Servlet as a switchboard to route requests from Web browsers to the appropriate ServerPage. This makes Web applications much easier to design, create, and maintain.</p>
</section>

<section href="javasoft" name="Is Struts compatible with other Java technologies?">
<p>Yes. Struts is committed to supporting industry standards. Our lead developer is a member of <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_052_jsptaglib.html">JSR052</a>, Sun's Expert group for developing a standard library of custom JSP tags. A primary design criteria is that Struts must be compatible with Sun's J2EE platform for corporate enterprises. In fact, Struts really acts as an integrator of Java technologies, so that they can be used in the &quot;real world&quot;.</p>
</section>

<section href="who" name="Who wrote Struts?">
<p>Struts was created by Craig R. McClanahan, and donated to the Apache Software Foundation in May 2000. Craig is the primary developer of both Struts and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">Tomcat 4</a>, the basis for the official reference implementation for a servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 container. With stable releases of Struts and Tomcat 4 in circulation, Craig is now the Specification Lead for <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/127.jsp">JavaServer Faces (JSR-127)</a>, and is the Web Layer Architect for the Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform as a whole.</p>
<p>There are now many active committers to the Struts project, working cooperatively from around the globe. Other Java developers are invited to <a href="#contribute">contribute to the project</a>. Struts is an <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a>  project, with the common mission to &quot;provide commercial-quality server solutions based on the Java Platform that are developed in an open and cooperative fashion&quot;. All told, 17 individual developers and committers contributed to the Struts 1.0 codebase.</p>
</section>

<section href="struts" name="Why is it called Struts?">
<p>It's a reference to struts in the architectural sense, a reminder of the nearly invisible pieces that hold up buildings, houses, and bridges.</p>
</section>

<section href="license" name="How is Struts licensed?">
<p>Struts is copyrighted software available under a &quot;free-to-use-license&quot; by the Apache Software Foundation. The license appears at the head of every source code file. A reference copy of the license is available <a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE-1.1">here</a>.</p>
</section>

<section href="usage" name="Can Struts be used in a commercial product?">
<p>Yes. The only requirements you must meet are those listed in the Apache Software Foundation license, which is included at the top of each source file and in the file LICENSE in the top-level directory of the distribution.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="#bugs">contributions of patches, improved code, new features,</a> or even just requests for features are also welcome.</p>
</section>

<section href="credits" name="Do I have to credit Struts on my own website?">
<p>You need to credit Struts if you <strong>redistribute your own framework</strong> based on Struts 
for other people to use. (See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE">Apache License</a> for details.) 
But you do <strong>not</strong> need to credit Struts just because your web application utilizes the framework. 
It's the same situation as using the Apache HTTPD server or Tomcat. Not required if its just running your web site. 
Required if you've used the source code to create your own server that you are redistributing to other people.</p>
</section>

<section href="where" name="Where can I get a copy of Struts?">
<p>The best place to download Struts is at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">jakarta.apache.org/struts</a>. The nightly builds are very stable, and recommended as the best place to start today.</p>
</section>

<section href="install" name="How do I install Struts?">
<p>To develop applications with Struts, you can usually just add the Struts JAR file
to your Java development environment. You can then start using the Struts classes as
part of your own application. A blank Struts application (in the
<code>webapps</code> directory, open <code>struts-blank.war</code>)
is provided, which you can just copy to get a quick-start on your own brainchild.</p>
<p>Since the full source code for Struts is available, we also provide
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/installation.html">complete instructions</a>
for compiling your own Struts JAR from scratch. (This is actually easier than it looks!)</p>
<p>Your Struts application can usually be deployed using a standard WAR file. In most
cases, you simply deposit the WAR file on your application server, and it is installed
automatically. If not, step-by-step installation instructions for
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/installation.html#Containers">various servlet
containers</a> are available.</p>
</section>

<section href="jar" name="When do I need &quot;struts.jar&quot; on my classpath?">
<p>When you are compiling an application that uses the Struts classes, you must have the &quot;struts.jar&quot; on the classpath your <b>compiler</b> sees -- it does not <i> have</i> to be on your CLASSPATH environment variable.</p>
<p>Why is that an important distinction? Because if you are using a servlet container on your development machine to test your application, the &quot;struts.jar&quot; <b>must not</b> be on your CLASSPATH environment variable when running the container. (This is because each Web application must also have their own copy of the Struts classes, and the container will become confused if it is on the environment path as well.)</p>
<p>There are several general approaches to this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use ANT</b> for building your projects -- it can easily assemble  classpaths for the compiler.  (This is how Struts itself is  built, along with Tomcat and most other Java-based projects).</li>
<li><b>Use an IDE</b> where you can configure the "class path" used  for compilation independent of the CLASSPATH environment  variable.</li>
<li><b>Use a shell script</b> that temporarily adds struts.jar  to the classpath just for compilation, for example<br/> 
<i>javac -classpath /path/to/struts.jar:$CLASSPATH $@</i></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section href="help" name="Where can I get help with Struts?">
<p>The Struts package comes complete with a 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/userGuide/index.html">Users Guide</a> to 
introduce people to the framework and its underlying technologies. Various components 
also have their own in-depth Developers Guide, to cover more advanced topics. Comprehensive 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/api/index.html">Javadocs</a> are included 
along with the <b>full source code</b>. For your convenience, these are bundled together as 
a self-installing application. The <code>struts-documentation.war</code> is the same 
bundle that is deployed as the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">Struts Web site</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">Strut's mailing list</a> is also 
very active, and welcomes posts from new users. Before posting a new question, be 
sure to consult the

</section>

<section href="taglibs" name="Why aren't the Struts tags maintained as part of the Jakarta Taglibs project?">
<p>Development of both products began about the same time. Leading up to the release of 1.0, it was thought better to continue to develop the taglibs alongside the controller. Now that 1.0 is out, the Java ServerPages Standard Taglib is in active development. Once work on the JSPTL stabilizes, the Struts taglibs will be revisited. Tags which are not linked directly to the framework may be hosted at Jakarta Taglibs instead.</p>
</section>

<section href="jsf" name="What about the JSTL and JavaServer Faces?">
<p>
The lead developer of Struts, Craig McClanahan, was a member of the 
expert group for the JavaServer Standard Tag Library (JSR 052) and 
now the specification lead for JavaServer Faces (JSR 127). Both 
technologies are complementary to Struts. 
</p>
<p>
The mainstay of the Struts framework is the controller components, which 
can be used with any Java presentation technology. As new technologies 
become available, it is certain that new "glue" components will also 
appear to help these technologies work as well with Struts as the 
bundled JSP tags. This would apply to both the JSTL and JSF.
</p>
<p>
At some point, we would not be surprised to see Faces become the
preferred UI implementation technology once it is standardized and 
available. You can be assured that any future migration will be 
made as painless as possible, and maximize your investment in 
Struts. 
</p>
<p>
The JSTL is available through the Jakarta Taglibs site: <br/>
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/standard-doc/intro.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/standard-doc/intro.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The JavaServer Faces specification is still being finalized. Public release of 
the specification is scheduled for Summer 2002, and an implementation may be 
available in Fall of 2002. <a href="http://servlet.java.sun.com/javaone/sf2002/conf/sessions/display-1697.en.jsp">
A presentation was given at JavaOne 2002</a> with some additional background.
</p>
</section>

<section href="tests" name="Does Struts include its own unit tests?">
<p>
Struts currently has two testing environments, to reflect the fact that
some things can be tested statically, and some really need to be done in
the environment of a running servlet container.</p>
<p>
For static unit tests, we use the <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit framework</a>.  
The sources for these tests are in the "src/test"
hierarchy in the CVS repository, and are executed via the "test.junit"
target in the top-level build.xml file.  Such tests are focused on the
low-level functionality of individual methods, are are particularly
suitable for the static methods in the org.apache.struts.util utility
classes.  In the test hierarchy, there are also some "mock object" classes
(in the org.apache.struts.mock package) so that you can package up things
that look like servlet API and Struts API objects to pass in as arguments
to such tests.</p>
<p>
This works fairly well for exercising most method-level stuff, but does
not really address situations of dynamic behavior -- most particularly the
execution of custom tags for Struts.  You can try to fake what a JSP
container does, but a much more reliable testing regime would actually
execute the tag in a real container.  For that purpose, we use the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus">Cactus</a>
testing framework , which re-executes
the JUnit-based tests as well to make sure that nothing bad happens when
you switch environments.  Right now, there are very few dynamic tests;
ideally, we will have tests for every tag, that cover every reasonable
combination of tag attribute values (yes, that's a tall order -- the
totally lines of test source code will undoubtedly exceed the totally
lines of code in the framework itself if we achieve this).</p>
</section>

<section href="bugs" name="Where can I report bugs or make feature requests?">
<p>You can research and report outstanding fixes and feature requests using 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">Jakarta Bugzilla</a>. If you 
are unsure if this is an actual problem, feel free to bring it up on the list 
first. But to be sure that an issue is resolved, read 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report 
Bugs Effectively</a> and report it to 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html"><b>Bugzilla</b></a>.</p>
<p>Feature requests are also maintained in the Bugzilla database. Some older 
requests are still listed on the <a href="../todo-1.1.html">wish list</a> 
page.</p>
<p><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/source.html">Patches</a> are always 
welcome. If you can't write a patch to fix your bug, a <a href="#tests">unit test</a> 
that demonstrates the problem is also welcome. 
(And, of course, unit tests that prove your patch work are equally 
welcome.)</p>
<p>If your bug or feature is already in Bugzilla, <strong>you can vote</strong> 
for the issue and call more attention to it. Each user can cast up to six 
votes at a time.</p>
<p>If there is a patch attached to the issue, you can also try applying 
to your local copy of Struts, and report whether it worked for you. 
Feedback from developers regarding a proposed patch is really quite 
helpful. Don't hesitate to "me too" if you've tried the patch yourself.
</p>
</section>

<section href="contribute" name="How can I contribute to the development of Struts?">
<p>Struts is distributed by the <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
These are the same people who distribute the Apache Web server. Like all ASF projects, Struts
is managed as a &quot;meritocracy&quot;, where everyone's contribution is welcome. Users can
help other users on the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">mailing lists</a>,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">report bugs</a>, and
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">request new features</a>. Developers can
contribute patches, new code, and documentation. The most active Developers may become
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/roles.html">Committers</a>, who make the actual
decisions about Strut's codebase.</p>
<p>
If you are new to open source development, see the 
"<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/getinvolved.html">How to get involved</a>" 
page on the main Jakarta site.</p>
<p>
A very good place to start is by reviewing the list of open issues and pending 
feature requests (<a href="#bugs">Bugzilla</a>).</p>
</section>

<section href="documentation" name="How can I contribute to the documentation?">
<p>The only difference is that the documentation is kept in XML rather than Java 
source code. Otherwise, all the same precepts and procedures pertain. </p>
<p>The trick to getting started is to download the nightly build and try 
building the documentation WAR. Then try adding your own XML page under doc/ to see 
if the build succeeds. If it doesn't, it will report where the bad element is, much 
like it reports where a bad programming expression is. If it does, then your page 
should be available under target/documention/. </p>
<p>The website portion of the package is the root directory of doc/. The User Guide 
portion is under the userGuide/ folder. If the material you'd to add doesn't 
fit right in with what's there, the best thing may be to start a new section after 
the existing material. The navigation column can be found in the project.xml document.</p>
<p>To display markup, substitute &amp;lt; for &lt;. The unmatched trailing > will be 
ignored. Since it is XML, all elements also need to be closed. So elements like 
&lt;br> and &lt;hr> need to be set out as &lt;br/> and &lt;hr/>.</p>
<p>Also watch for the length of code samples. These do not wrap. If a line is too long, 
it will force the right margin out past the edge of the screen or printed page. </p>
<p>The stylesheets we use are adequate, but could certainly be improved by an XML 
guru, if you happen to be one of those.</p>
</section>

<section href="release" name="When is the next release coming out?">
<p>Here is the truth regarding releases:</p>
<p>
Jakarta products are released on the basis of merit, and ~not~ according
to a strict timetable. The volunteers devote whatever time they can to working
on the product. But all volunteers have real jobs and real lives, that 
do take precedence. Since Struts does not have paid personnel working 
on the project, we simply cannot make date-oriented commitments.
</p>
<p>
All Jakarta products must circulate a public beta before release. If a
beta is not in circulation, then it's a good bet that a release is not
forthcoming any time soon. Products sometimes go through several betas
before final release. So if this is beta 1, then it still may not be
released any time soon.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line is that Jakarta takes releases very seriously. We do not
compromise the quality of our software by watching the calendar (and
then ship something ready or not). A release is ready when it is ready.
</p>
<p>
That may sound flip, but it ~is~ the truth. The delivery of
production-quality, leading-edge software is not something anyone can 
prognosticate. If anyone tries, they are lying to you. That, we won't 
do ;-)
</p>
<p>
What we ~will~ do is release all of our development software as soon as it
is developed. This way you can judge for yourself how quickly the
development is proceeding, and whether what is being developed will meet
your needs. If you need a feature right now, you can use the nightly
build, or roll your own patch. There are no private CVS's or private 
development lists. What you see is what we got. If you are following the
DEV list, then you know everything the developers know. Really, you do.
</p>
<p>
<i>So, what do you tell your team?</i> If you can ship your application based 
on the nightly build of your choice, then consider that an option. You can 
still ship yours, even if we don't ship ours, and you will have access to 
all the latest patches or enhancements. (Just like we were working down 
the hall.) If you can only ship your application based on a release build of 
Struts, then you should base your development on the release build of Struts, 
and keep an eye on what is coming down the pipeline. This way you are at least 
forewarned and forearmed.
</p>
</section>

<section href="release_help" name="What can I do to help the next release along?">
<ul>
<li>Most importantly, download the latest beta and release-candidate and test 
it against your own applications. Report any and all issues or suspected issues 
to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">Bugzilla</a>. The sooner 
we resolve any problems, the fewer betas or release candidates we will have to 
distribute before we are done. (How do we know when we done? -- When we run out 
of issues =:o) The sooner we find them, the sooner we are done.)</li>

<li>Review the list of issues at Bugzilla. If there are any you can respond to, 
please do. If there any patches posted, feel free to test the patch on your 
system and report the results.</li>

<li>Contribute <a href="tests">unit tests</a>. The closer we get to a release, the 
more we worry about breaking something. The more tests we have, the more 
confident we can be when applying patches. A test that proves there is bug are 
the most welcome. But we are eager for any and all tests for any and all 
features, even those that already work =:0).</li>

<li><strong>Feel free to use Bugzilla to vote for any issues you feel should be handled 
first.</strong> We don't guarantee that we will alwasy follow the vote, but we do value 
the input!</li>

<li>If an issue on your ballot doesn't include a patch, feel free to try coding 
one yourself. (At Jakarta, patches are the only votes that really count.) 
Well over <a href="volunteers.html">thirty developers</a> have contributed code or 
documentation to the product. You can too =:0)</li>

<li>Help out on the mailing lists. The Committers only have so much time to 
volunteer. If Developers are supporting each other on the lists, the 
Committers have more time to spend on the next release. </li>

<section href="why" name="Why do we need Struts?">
<p>Java technologies give developers a serious boost when creating and maintaining applications to meet the demands of today's public Web sites and enterprise intranets. Struts combines Java Servlets, Java ServerPages, custom tags, and message resources into a unified framework. The end result is a cooperative, synergistic platform, suitable for development teams, independent developers, and everyone in between.</p>
</section>

<section href="how" name="How does Struts work?">
<p>Java Servlets are designed to handle requests made by Web browsers. Java ServerPages are designed to create dynamic Web pages that can turn billboard sites into live applications. Struts uses a special Servlet as a switchboard to route requests from Web browsers to the appropriate ServerPage. This makes Web applications much easier to design, create, and maintain.</p>
</section>

<section href="javasoft" name="Is Struts compatible with other Java technologies?">
<p>Yes. Struts is committed to supporting industry standards. Our lead developer is a member of <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_052_jsptaglib.html">JSR052</a>, Sun's Expert group for developing a standard library of custom JSP tags. A primary design criteria is that Struts must be compatible with Sun's J2EE platform for corporate enterprises. In fact, Struts really acts as an integrator of Java technologies, so that they can be used in the &quot;real world&quot;.</p>
</section>

<section href="who" name="Who wrote Struts?">
<p>Struts was created by Craig R. McClanahan, and donated to the Apache Software Foundation in May 2000. Craig is the primary developer of both Struts and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">Tomcat 4</a>, the basis for the official reference implementation for a servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 container. With stable releases of Struts and Tomcat 4 in circulation, Craig is now the Specification Lead for <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/127.jsp">JavaServer Faces (JSR-127)</a>, and is the Web Layer Architect for the Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform as a whole.</p>
<p>There are now many active committers to the Struts project, working cooperatively from around the globe. Other Java developers are invited to <a href="#contribute">contribute to the project</a>. Struts is an <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a>  project, with the common mission to &quot;provide commercial-quality server solutions based on the Java Platform that are developed in an open and cooperative fashion&quot;. All told, 17 individual developers and committers contributed to the Struts 1.0 codebase.</p>
</section>

<section href="struts" name="Why is it called Struts?">
<p>It's a reference to struts in the architectural sense, a reminder of the nearly invisible pieces that hold up buildings, houses, and bridges.</p>
</section>

<section href="license" name="How is Struts licensed?">
<p>Struts is copyrighted software available under a &quot;free-to-use-license&quot; by the Apache Software Foundation. The license appears at the head of every source code file. A reference copy of the license is available <a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE-1.1">here</a>.</p>
</section>

<section href="usage" name="Can Struts be used in a commercial product?">
<p>Yes. The only requirements you must meet are those listed in the Apache Software Foundation license, which is included at the top of each source file and in the file LICENSE in the top-level directory of the distribution.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="helping.html#bugs">contributions of patches, improved code, new features,</a> or even just requests for features are also welcome.</p>
</section>

<section href="credits" name="Do I have to credit Struts on my own website?">
<p>You need to credit Struts if you <strong>redistribute your own framework</strong> based on Struts
for other people to use. (See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE">Apache License</a> for details.)
But you do <strong>not</strong> need to credit Struts just because your web application utilizes the framework.
It's the same situation as using the Apache HTTPD server or Tomcat. Not required if its just running your web site.
Required if you've used the source code to create your own server that you are redistributing to other people.</p>
</section>

<section href="where" name="Where can I get a copy of Struts?">
<p>The best place to download Struts is at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">jakarta.apache.org/struts</a>. The nightly builds are very stable, and recommended as the best place to start today.</p>
</section>

<section href="install" name="How do I install Struts?">
<p>To develop applications with Struts, you can usually just add the Struts JAR file
to your Java development environment. You can then start using the Struts classes as
part of your own application. A blank Struts application (in the
<code>webapps</code> directory, open <code>struts-blank.war</code>)
is provided, which you can just copy to get a quick-start on your own brainchild.</p>
<p>Since the full source code for Struts is available, we also provide
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/installation.html">complete instructions</a>
for compiling your own Struts JAR from scratch. (This is actually easier than it looks!)</p>
<p>Your Struts application can usually be deployed using a standard WAR file. In most
cases, you simply deposit the WAR file on your application server, and it is installed
automatically. If not, step-by-step installation instructions for
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/installation.html#Containers">various servlet
containers</a> are available.</p>
</section>

<section href="jar" name="When do I need &quot;struts.jar&quot; on my classpath?">
<p>When you are compiling an application that uses the Struts classes, you must have the &quot;struts.jar&quot; on the classpath your <b>compiler</b> sees -- it does not <i> have</i> to be on your CLASSPATH environment variable.</p>
<p>Why is that an important distinction? Because if you are using a servlet container on your development machine to test your application, the &quot;struts.jar&quot; <b>must not</b> be on your CLASSPATH environment variable when running the container. (This is because each Web application must also have their own copy of the Struts classes, and the container will become confused if it is on the environment path as well.)</p>
<p>There are several general approaches to this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use ANT</b> for building your projects -- it can easily assemble  classpaths for the compiler.  (This is how Struts itself is  built, along with Tomcat and most other Java-based projects).</li>
<li><b>Use an IDE</b> where you can configure the "class path" used  for compilation independent of the CLASSPATH environment  variable.</li>
<li><b>Use a shell script</b> that temporarily adds struts.jar  to the classpath just for compilation, for example<br/>
<i>javac -classpath /path/to/struts.jar:$CLASSPATH $@</i></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section href="tests" name="Does Struts include its own unit tests?">
<p>
Struts currently has two testing environments, to reflect the fact that
some things can be tested statically, and some really need to be done in
the environment of a running servlet container.</p>
<p>
For static unit tests, we use the <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit framework</a>.
The sources for these tests are in the "src/test"
hierarchy in the CVS repository, and are executed via the "test.junit"
target in the top-level build.xml file.  Such tests are focused on the
low-level functionality of individual methods, are are particularly
suitable for the static methods in the org.apache.struts.util utility
classes.  In the test hierarchy, there are also some "mock object" classes
(in the org.apache.struts.mock package) so that you can package up things
that look like servlet API and Struts API objects to pass in as arguments
to such tests.</p>
</section>

<section href="help" name="Where can I get help with Struts?">
<p>The Struts package comes complete with a
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/userGuide/index.html">Users Guide</a> to
introduce people to the framework and its underlying technologies. Various components
also have their own in-depth Developers Guide, to cover more advanced topics. Comprehensive
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/api/index.html">Javadocs</a> are included
along with the <b>full source code</b>. For your convenience, these are bundled together as
a self-installing application. The <code>struts-documentation.war</code> is the same
bundle that is deployed as the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">Struts Web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">Strut's mailing list</a> is also
very active, and welcomes posts from new users. Before posting a new question, be

</ul>
</section>

<section href="taglibs" name="Why aren't the Struts tags maintained as part of the Jakarta Taglibs project?">
<p>Development of both products began about the same time. Leading up to the release of 1.0, it was thought better to continue to develop the taglibs alongside the controller. Now that 1.0 is out, the Java ServerPages Standard Taglib is in active development. Once work on the JSPTL stabilizes, the Struts taglibs will be revisited. Tags which are not linked directly to the framework may be hosted at Jakarta Taglibs instead.</p>
</section>

<section href="jsf" name="What about the JSTL and JavaServer Faces?">
<p>
The lead developer of Struts, Craig McClanahan, was a member of the
expert group for the JavaServer Standard Tag Library (JSR 052) and
now the specification lead for JavaServer Faces (JSR 127). Both
technologies are complementary to Struts.
</p>
<p>
The mainstay of the Struts framework is the controller components, which
can be used with any Java presentation technology. As new technologies
become available, it is certain that new "glue" components will also
appear to help these technologies work as well with Struts as the
bundled JSP tags. This would apply to both the JSTL and JSF.
</p>
<p>
At some point, we would not be surprised to see Faces become the
preferred UI implementation technology once it is standardized and
available. You can be assured that any future migration will be
made as painless as possible, and maximize your investment in
Struts.
</p>
<p>
The JSTL is available through the Jakarta Taglibs site: <br/>
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/standard-doc/intro.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/standard-doc/intro.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The JavaServer Faces specification is still being finalized. Public release of
the specification is scheduled for Summer 2002, and an implementation may be
available in Fall of 2002. <a href="http://servlet.java.sun.com/javaone/sf2002/conf/sessions/display-1697.en.jsp">
A presentation was given at JavaOne 2002</a> with some additional background.

  </properties>

  <body>


  <section name="Welcome to Struts" href="Welcome">

  <p>
  Welcome to Struts!  The goal of this project
  is to provide an open source framework for building Web applications.
  The core of Struts is a flexible control layer based on <a href="userGuide/preface.html">standard
  technologies</a> like
  Java Servlets,
  JavaBeans,
  ResourceBundles,
  and Extensible Markup Language (XML).
  </p>
  <p>
  Struts encourages application architectures based on the Model 2 approach,
  a variation of the classic
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier5.html"><b>Model-View-Controller</b></a> (MVC) design paradigm. Struts
  provides its own <b>Controller</b> component and integrates
  with <a href="userGuide/preface.html#layers">other technologies</a> to provide the Model and the View.
  For the <b>Model</b>, Struts can interact with any
  <a href="resources/models.html">standard data access technology</a>, including Enterprise Java Beans, JDBC, and Object Relational Bridge.
  For the <b>View</b>, Struts works well with JavaServer Pages, Velocity Templates,
  XSLT, <a href="resources/views.html">other presentation systems</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts framework provides the invisible underpinnings every
  professional Web application needs to survive. Struts helps you
  create an extensible development environment for your application,
  based on published standards and proven design patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
  Struts is part of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta
  Project</a>, sponsored by the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.  The
  official Struts home page is at
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">http://jakarta.apache.org/struts</a>.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Learning About Struts" href="Docs">

  <p>
  The <b>official documentation</b> for the framework is provided both online
  and as a self-installing WAR in the distribution. The
  <code>struts-documentation.war</code> includes the
  <a href="kickstart.html">Kickstart</a>,
  <a href="newbie.html">Newbie</a>, and
  <a href="helping.html">How to Help</a> FAQs,
  <a href="userGuide/index.html">Users Guide</a>,
  <a href="api/index.html">Javadocs</a>, and everything else you find here.
  You are invited to preview the documentation online, and then install the
  application locally for closer study.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Note: Most of the links in this section refer to the <b>Nightly Build</b>.
  When learning about Struts, <b>be sure to refer to the documentation for the
  version you are actually using</b>. The documentation is bundled with each
  distribution as an application that you can install locally. Links to the
  documentation for the current stable release (1.0.2) are also provided on the
  menu bar. Whenever possible, please help conserve our bandwidth, and install
  the documentation locally.
  </blockquote>

  <p><a name="faqs"></a>
  The <a href="kickstart.html"><b>Kickstart FAQ</b></a> answers the most common
  non-technical questions people first ask about Struts. The
  <a href="newbie.html">Struts Newbie FAQ</a> answers the most common
  technical questions asked by first-timer Struts developers. The
  <a href="helping.html">How to Help</a> FAQ answers the most common questions
  about contributing to the Jakarta-Struts project. A more extensive
  Struts knowledgebase is available at the
  <a href="http://jguru.com/faq/Struts">JGuru FAQ</a> and
  <a href="http://jguru.com/forums/Struts">Forum</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The concise Struts <a href="userGuide/index.html"><b>Users Guide</b></a> introduces the
  Model-View-Controller architecture, and how it relates to the major components of Struts.
  To help you get started with the Struts JSP tag extensions and utility packages,
  several <b>Developer Guides</b> supplement the Users Guide. The Users Guide also
  includes detailed installation instructions and release notes for each version of the
  framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  For more detail about a specific class or package, the Struts
  <a href="api/index.html"><b>Javadocs</b></a>
  are <b>surprisingly comprehensive and carefully maintained</b>. It is <i>strongly</i> recommended that
  you refer to the
  <a href="api/index.html">
  Javadoc</a> for each class as you begin to use it, to be sure important features
  and options are not overlooked. <i>What you don't know, can't help you.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  Of course, the only true documentation is the code itself. If you have any questions
  about how Struts actually works, do not hesitate to <i>use the source</i>. For the
  complete, buildable source code to the entire Struts framework, see the "src" folder in
  the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/release/v1.0.2/src/">
  <b>Struts 1.0.2 source distribution</b></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts <a href="#Involved">Mailing Lists</a> are a treasure trove of useful,
  interactive information. The user list tends to carry a high volume, so always check
  the published documentation and the
  <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=42">
  <b>MAILING LIST ARCHIVE</b></a> before
  <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">posting a new question</a>.
  Like as not, it's already been asked and answered.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you really can't find the answer to your question in the <a href="#faqs">FAQs</a> or
  <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=42">list archive</a>,
  you can post your query to the Struts User list -- <b>BUT YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE TO THE
  <a href="mailto:struts-user-subscribe@jakarta.apache.org">USER LIST</a>
  OR THE
  <a href="mailto:struts-user-digest-subscribe@jakarta.apache.org">USER LIST DIGEST</a>
  BEFORE POSTING</b>. If you would rather not subscribe to a list, you can go through the
  <a href="http://www.proj.com/subscribe.jsp">BaseBeans Struts Newsgroup</a> instead.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Please note that the Struts User list enjoys a "casual friday" policy. More off-topic
  messages are tolerated on Fridays so long as the message is prefixed with the token
  [FRIDAY]. If you'd rather not be troubled by these postings, please set your
  mail filter accordingly. Posting [FRIDAY] articles on any other weekday is <b>strongly
  discouraged</b>. We thank you for your cooperation.

  <section name="Acquiring Struts" href="Acquiring">

  <p>
  The <i>production release</i> of <strong>Struts 1.0.2</strong> is available in
  a convenient binary distribution and also with complete source code. In
  addition, a library distribution is available, which contains the latest
  Struts binaries without the sample applications, providing a smaller,
  faster download.

  </p>

  <p>
  The latest <i>beta release</i> of <strong>Struts 1.1</strong> is also
  available, in the same three distributions. While not necessarily quite as
  stable as the latest production release, the beta release provides an interim
  release between the nightly builds and the production release so that
  developers can start taking advantage of new functionality without the same
  degree of risk as using the nightly builds may entail.

  <section name="Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests" href="Bugs">

  <p>
  Tracking of bug reports and enhancement requests for Struts is handled
  through the
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">
  Apache Bug Database</a>. Please select <strong>Struts</strong> from the product
  list, along with the details of which component of Struts you feel this report
  relates to, and details of your operating environment. You will automatically be
  notified by email as the status of your bug or enhancement report changes. Please
  be sure to read
  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report
  Bugs Effectively</a> before posting.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Contributing Patches to Code or Documentation" href="Patches">

  <p>
  You can upload a proposed <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/source.html#Patches">
  patch</a> to either the code or documentation by creating a feature request in
  <a href="#Bugs">Bugzilla</a>. <b>After creating the ticket</b>, you can go back
  and upload a file containing your patch.
  </p>
  <p>
  The documentation is maintained in the <code>doc</code> folder of the CVS in a
  XML format. In the Nightly Build, there is a "compile.website" target in the
  <code>build.xml</code> file, which renders the XML into the HTML we post to the
  Website. If you would like to help with the documentation, it is important to
  provide patches and new pages in the XML source. Otherwise, some other volunteer
  will have to do this for you, and it may never get done. (Sad but true.) If you
  are submitting new material, it is important to decide exactly where you would
  put this in relation to the rest of the documentation. Someone has to figure that
  out before it can be added, and that someone might as well be you.
  </p>
  <p>
  New additions for the Resources page should posted as an enhancement request to
  <a href="#Bugs">Bugzilla</a>.

  <section name="Welcome to Struts" href="Welcome">

  <p>Welcome to the Struts Framework!  The goal of this project
  is to provide an open source framework useful in building web applications
  with Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet</a> and
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</a> (JSP)
  technology.  Struts encourages application architectures based on the
  Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm, colloquially known as
  <i>Model 2</i> in discussions on various servlet and JSP related
  mailing lists.</p>

  <p>Struts includes the following primary areas of functionality:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A controller servlet that dispatches requests to appropriate
      <strong>Action</strong> classes provided by the application
      developer.</li>
  <li>JSP custom tag libraries, and associated support in the controller
      servlet, that assists developers in creating interactive form-based
      applications.</li>
  <li>Utility classes to support XML parsing, automatic population of
      JavaBeans properties based on the Java reflection APIs, and
      internationalization of prompts and messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Struts is part of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta
  Project</a>, sponsored by the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.  The
  official Struts home page is at
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">http://jakarta.apache.org/struts</a>.

  <section name="Welcome to Struts" href="Welcome">

  <p>Welcome to the Struts Framework!  The goal of this project
  is to provide an open source framework useful in building web applications
  with Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet</a> and
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</a> (JSP)
  technology.  Struts encourages application architectures based on the
  Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm, colloquially known as
  <i>Model 2</i> in discussions on various servlet and JSP related
  mailing lists.</p>

  <p>Struts includes the following primary areas of functionality:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A controller servlet that dispatches requests to appropriate
      <strong>Action</strong> classes provided by the application
      developer.</li>
  <li>JSP custom tag libraries, and associated support in the controller
      servlet, that assists developers in creating interactive form-based
      applications.</li>
  <li>Utility classes to support XML parsing, automatic population of
      JavaBeans properties based on the Java reflection APIs, and
      internationalization of prompts and messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Struts is part of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta
  Project</a>, sponsored by the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.  The
  official Struts home page is at
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">http://jakarta.apache.org/struts</a>.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Learning About Struts" href="Docs">

  <p>The <a href="userGuide/kickstart.html"><b>Kickstart FAQ</b></a> quickly answers 
  the most common questions about Struts.</p>

  <p>A concise <a href="userGuide/index.html"><b>Users Guide</b></a> is also provided 
  with the distribution. The User Guide introduces the Model View Controller 
  architecture, and how it relates to the major components of Struts. Several Developer 
  Guides are also provided, to help you get started with the Struts tag extensions and 
  utility packages.</p>

  <p>For more detail about a specific class or package, the Struts 
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/api-1.0/index.html"><b>Javadocs</b></a>
  are comprehensive and carefully maintained. It is strongly recommended that 
  you refer to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/api-1.0/index.html">Javadoc</a> 
  for each class as you begin to use it, to be sure important features and options 
  are not overlooked. What you don't know, can't help you.</p>

  <p>Of course, the only true documentation is the code itself. If you have any questions 
  about how Struts actually works, do not hestate to <i>use the source</i>. For the 
  complete, buildable source code to the entire Struts framework, see the "src" folder in 
  the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/release/v1.0.1/src/"><b>Struts 1.0.1 source distribution</b></a>.</p>

  <p>The Struts <a href="userGuide/resources.html"><b>Resources</b></a> page provides links to 
  everything else written about  Struts, including books, articles, tutorials, and sample 
  applications. There are also links to public sites "Powered by Struts". </p>

  <p>
  The Struts <a href="news.html"><b>News &amp; Status</b></a> page tracks changes to the 
  Struts package, including proposals for new features and the latest additions to the 
  resources page.

  <section name="Acquiring Struts" href="Acquiring">

  <p>The production release of <strong>Struts 1.0.1</strong> is available in
  in convenient binary distribution and also with complete source code. In
  addition, a library distribution is available, which contains the latest
  Struts binaries without the sample applications, providing a smaller,
  faster download.</p>

  <ul>

  <p>Check the <a href="release-notes-1.0.1.html">Release Notes</a>
  for a summary of what new features have been added and other 
  changes since the Struts 1.0 release.</p>

  <p><b>In addition to a Struts distribution,</b> you will need to ensure that
  you have downloaded and installed all of the
  <a href="installation.html#Prerequisites">prerequisite</a> software
  applications. Then, follow the appropriate instructions to
  <a href="installation.html#Installing">install and use a Struts binary 
  distribution</a> in your web application or for
  <a href="installation.html#Building">building Struts from the source
  distribution</a>.</p>

Chapter 10 - Exception Handling <br/>
This chapter will look at how you can properly use the Java exception handling mechanism
within your Struts applications to help make your applications more industrial-strength and
allow them to gracefully respond when things don't go as expected. Special attention will be
given to the differences between performing the exception handling programmatically and
using the new declarative feature added to the new version of Struts.

Chapter 5 - Struts Controller Components <br/>
The Struts framework uses a servlet to process incoming requests, however it relies on many
other components that are part of the controller domain, to help it carry out its
responsibilities. The Struts controller components have been briefly mentioned in previous
chapters, but it's time to take in-depth look at what components have responsibility for the
controller functionality in the framework. 
</p>
<p>
Chapter 6 - Struts Model Components <br/>
This chapter introduces the components that make up the model portion of a Struts
application. The model represents the business data for an application and should closely
resemble the real-world entities and business processes for the organization. We will explore
the roles and responsibilities of the model components within the Struts framework and focus on building an architecturally correct
implementation for the storefront application. Special attention will be given to using a persistence framework that can be easily and effortlessly
integrated into a Struts application.

<h3><a name="20020501"></a>01 May 2002 - stxx 0.9.5 is available</h3>
<p>
The latest update to stxx is available at<br/>
<a href="http://www.openroad.ca/opencode/">www.openroad.ca/opencode/</a>
</p>
<p>
The biggest change in this version is the ability to have your transform 
tags do xsl:fo transformations (for example to PDF or SVG).
</p>
<p>
There are also bug fixes and updates to the examples.
</p>
<p>
Struts for transforming XML with XSL (stxx) is an extension of the 
Struts framework to support XML and XSL without changing the 
functionality of Struts .
</p>
<p>
stxx sits on top of Struts, extending it's existing functionality to 
allow Action classes to return XML that will be transformed by an XSL file.
</p>
<p>
The idea of stxx is to remove the need to be use JSP and TagLibs for the 
presentation layer of this framework. However, stxx does not force you 
to go the XML/XSL route, both technologies work side by side.

<h3><a name="20020425"></a>25 Apr 2002 - O'Reilly Chapters 1 and 2</h3>
<p>
Chapters 1 and 2 of the upcoming Struts book by Chuck Cavaness are now available on

</p>
<p>
Chapter 1 - Introduction
This introduction chapter discusses some preliminary concepts such as MVC, Model 2, and the idea of a software framework. Although many
developers may understand some or all of the ideas presented here, the inclusion of the material is necessary to ensure all readers are starting
from the same place. The concepts presented in this chapter help to lay the foundation for the rest of the book. 
</p>
<p>
Chapter 2 - Inside the Web Tier
The Struts framework is based on the Java Servlet Technology and to a lesser extent, JavaServer Pages, and therefore is tightly coupled to a
web container. For Struts developers, understanding how the web container processes client requests is fundamental to having a deeper
understanding of the framework itself. This chapter illustrates the various components that are part of the web container and what each
component's responsibilities are.

<h3><a name="20020304"></a>04 March 2002 - Best Practice with Expresso-Struts Framework</h3>
<p>
In this article, Peter Pilgrim looks at the best practice of using a popular web
application toolkit, The Expresso Framework. The Expresso Framework, until version 3, had its
own Model View Controller engine. It now  integrates Struts, further reducing the amount of
code that developers need to write. As well as having an  MVC framework, Struts also has its
own powerful custom tag actions. Custom tag libraries and their powerful bean introspection
core further reduce the total amount of Java scriptlets in Java Server Pages."

<h3><a name="20020301"></a>01 March 2002 - Simper 0.2</h3>
<p>
Simper is a simple JDBC persistence mechanism for Java web apps. It
features many of the interesting features of EJB, such as automatic
transaction demarcation (by way of Servlet Filters), and automatic
change detection of database rows (by way of DynaBeans). Lastly, the
notation by which you reference rows, as well as relations between
tables, is extremely JSP friendly.

<p>
0.2 is not a new release (it's been out for about a month), but, a
SourceForge project has been set up, with mailing lists, CVS, etc., so
that others can discuss and contribute (as I am getting quite busy
lately)

<h3><a name="20020228.3"></a>28 February 2002 - Struts Whitepaper</h3>

<h3><a name="20020228.2"></a>28 February 2002 - Struts Workflow Extension Package</h3>
<p>
To all struts users!
</p>
<p>
It has been quite some time since I first announced the Struts Workflow
Extension Package. Since then, I have received several requests for an example
application and pretty good ideas for further enhancements. Here now is the 
first official release that includes an example application and most of the 
suggested enhancements.
</p>
<p>
I know that there is a proposal and already some work going on in the Jakarta
Commons Project for a generic workflow package that is not directly based on 
Struts, but should be easily integratable. Unfortunately this work is not 
progressing as quickly as some struts user would like to see. Thus, if you have 
a need (and in each Web-Application you normally have) for workflow control, try 
this extension and check whether it is appropriate for you.

<h3><a name="20020223"></a>23 February 2002 - New Plugin mechanism</h3>
<p>
A new lightweight PlugIn mechanism is now available in the nightly build.

<p>
The PlugIn API is somewhat stripped down compared to the ServiceManager, so
it's possible that it won't meet your needs. The ServiceManager itself has
largely been moved to Jakarta Commons, and is currently in the sandbox:

<h3><a name="20020212"></a>12 February 2002 - Stxx for transforming XML</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.oroad.com/opencode/">
<b>Struts for transforming XML with XSL</b></a> (stxx) is an extension of 
the Struts framework to enhance support for XML and XSL.
</p>
<p>
stxx sits on top of Struts, extending it's existing functionality to allow
Action classes to return XML that will be transformed by an XSL file.
</p>
<p>
The idea of stxx is to remove the need to be use JSP and TagLibs for the
presentation layer of this framework. However, stxx does not force you to go the
XML/XSL route, both technologies should work side by side.
</p>
<p>
So, adding XSL support to struts is ALMOST as simple as adding the following
tags to your struts-config.xml file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;action path="/welcome"
        type="com.oroad.stxx.example.ExampleWelcomeAction"
        scope="request">
        &lt;forward name="success">
&lt;!-- 
    the transform tags take the XML returned by the Action
    and transform them. The transform tag used is determined
    by matching the user agent against the name attribute (or
    default if nothing matches)
-->
                &lt;transform name="default" path="/login.xsl"/>
                &lt;transform name="Mozilla" path="/login_netscape.xsl"/>
                &lt;transform name="MSIE" path="/login_msie.xsl"/>
        &lt;/forward>
&lt;/action>
</pre>
<p>
stxx features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enhances the &lt;forward> tag in the struts-config.xml file to allow
one to many &lt;transform> tags. These &lt;transform> tags represent 
the XSL file to be used depending on the user-agent of the 
browser accessing struts
</li><li>
A new class variable for the Action class, A JDOM Document, which 
you use to append your data in your Action class too. This 
Document object will be transformed by the XSL file in your 
&lt;transform> tag.
</li><li>
stxx automatically flattens the ApplicationResources file to XML 
and attaches it to the Document object returned by the new Action   
class.
</li><li>
stxx also automatically appends the request parameters and 
attributes, as well as ActionErrors as XML to the Document 
object.
</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Please note: stxx is a work in progress, however, at this point I've been using
it for about 4 months and it works great for me, I realize it might not fit
everyone elses needs. Please send me feedback, opinions, complains, etc.

<h3><a name="20020118"></a>18 Jan 2002 - Nested Taglib added to nightly build</h3>

defined with the <code>nest</code> tag, and other Struts tags within that 
tag can simply refer to the "child" property. Tags can be nested arbitarily 
deep.

<h3><a name="20020112.2"></a>12 Jan 2002 - MultiApp Capability Added</h3>
<p>
Support for multiple application modules has been added to the nightly build. 
Developers can now provide multiple Struts configuration files, each of which 
can defines its own "module prefix". All of the "context-relative" values in 
the Struts configuration are now "module-relative". Struts components which '
handle context-relative URIs now transparently handle module-relative URIs. 
</p>
<p>
Existing configuration files, JavaServer Pages, or Actions do not need to be 
changed to use this capability. The only change is to specify the module 
prefix to be used with each additional configuration. 
</p>
<p>
This feature allows different teams to work on different parts of an 
application at the same time, without conflict over the configuration file. 
It also allows Struts applications that were developed independantly to be 
easily merged. 
</p>
<p>
Formal documentation is pending. See the Mailing List Archive for details.

<h3><a name="20020212"></a>12 February 2002 - Stxx for transforming XML</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.oroad.com/opencode/">
<b>Struts for transforming XML with XSL</b></a> (stxx) is an extension of 
the Struts framework to enhance support for XML and XSL.
</p>
<p>
stxx sits on top of Struts, extending it's existing functionality to allow
Action classes to return XML that will be transformed by an XSL file.
</p>
<p>
The idea of stxx is to remove the need to be use JSP and TagLibs for the
presentation layer of this framework. However, stxx does not force you to go the
XML/XSL route, both technologies should work side by side.
</p>
<p>
So, adding XSL support to struts is ALMOST as simple as adding the following
tags to your struts-config.xml file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;action path="/welcome"
        type="com.oroad.stxx.example.ExampleWelcomeAction"
        scope="request">
        &lt;forward name="success">
&lt;!-- 
    the transform tags take the XML returned by the Action
    and transform them. The transform tag used is determined
    by matching the user agent against the name attribute (or
    default if nothing matches)
-->
                &lt;transform name="default" path="/login.xsl"/>
                &lt;transform name="Mozilla" path="/login_netscape.xsl"/>
                &lt;transform name="MSIE" path="/login_msie.xsl"/>
        &lt;/forward>
&lt;/action>
</pre>
<p>
stxx features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enhances the &lt;forward> tag in the struts-config.xml file to allow
one to many &lt;transform> tags. These &lt;transform> tags represent 
the XSL file to be used depending on the user-agent of the 
browser accessing struts
</li><li>
A new class variable for the Action class, A JDOM Document, which 
you use to append your data in your Action class too. This 
Document object will be transformed by the XSL file in your 
&lt;transform> tag.
</li><li>
stxx automatically flattens the ApplicationResources file to XML 
and attaches it to the Document object returned by the new Action   
class.
</li><li>
stxx also automatically appends the request parameters and 
attributes, as well as ActionErrors as XML to the Document 
object.
</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Please note: stxx is a work in progress, however, at this point I've been using
it for about 4 months and it works great for me, I realize it might not fit
everyone elses needs. Please send me feedback, opinions, complains, etc.

<h3><a name="20020118"></a>18 Jan 2002 - Nested Taglib added to nightly build</h3>
<p>
Struts tags support a dotted notation to refer to a nested beans. The Nested 
Talib extends this notation to automatically include a parent tag. Instead of 
referring to a property as parent<strong>.</strong>child, "parent" can be 
defined with the <code>nest</code> tag, and other Struts tags within that 
tag can simply refer to the "child" property. Tags can be nested arbitarily 
deep. 
</p>

<h3>14 January 2002 - New Committer, Arron Bates </h3>
<p>
Arron Bates, known for his interesting and popular nesting extension to 
the Struts taglibs has been elected as a Struts Committer.

<h3><a name="20020112.2"></a>12 Jan 2002 - MultiApp Capability Added</h3>
<p>
Support for multiple application modules has been added to the nightly build. 
Developers can now provide multiple Struts configuration files, each of which 
can defines its own "module prefix". All of the "context-relative" values in 
the Struts configuration are now "module-relative". Struts components which '
handle context-relative URIs now transparently handle module-relative URIs. 
</p>
<p>
Existing configuration files, JavaServer Pages, or Actions do not need to be 
changed to use this capability. The only change is to specify the module 
prefix to be used with each additional configuration. 
</p>
<p>
This feature allows different teams to work on different parts of an 
application at the same time, without conflict over the configuration file. 
It also allows Struts applications that were developed independantly to be 
easily merged. 
</p>
<p>
Formal documentation is pending. See the Mailing List Archive for details.

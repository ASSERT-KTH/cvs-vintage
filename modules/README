This directory is for various modules that are not part of the 
normal tomcat release.

The goal is to keep the tomcat release as small and focused as
possible, and include only the stable modules, but still allow
users to add or try other modules..

Examples:
- different authentication schemes ( the "digested" auth, LDAP, etc )
- different loggers ( log4j, etc )
- session persistence
- ajp14
- etc.

Each module can be build independently, and will act as an add-on
for the stable release of tomcat. Tomcat can remain focused to a 
strict and minimal implementation of the API, and all specialized
modules can be developed without impacting the release cycle.

Note: some of the existing modules in tomcat fit in this category.
We can move them here only with a vote on tomcat-dev, since they
were part of previous releases.

1. Introduction

   This document is intended to get you started using Tomcat with
   Apache until we have Apache and Tomcat as one integrated
   release. If you ran into any gotchas while following these
   instructions, please let us know so we can keep this document
   updated. 

   In the rest of the document, we use /path/to/apache-1.3.9 to mean
   the path to the Apache 1.3.9 installation and /path/to/tomcat1.0r1
   to mean the path to the Tomcat 1.0 R1 installation. We will assume
   you are running Apache on the default port (80). 

2. Installation

   2.1 Apache 1.3.9 

       * Download and install the Apache 1.3.9 binary for your
         platform from 

	   http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries

       * Configure the default HTTP listener port in your
         /path/to/apache-1.3.9/conf/httpd.conf file.

       * Make sure ServerName in /path/to/apache-1.3.9/conf/httpd.conf
         contains the name of your host.

   2.2 Tomcat v1.0 R1

       * Download and install Tomcat v1.0 R1 for your OS/platform from
  
	   http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v1.0R1/<os>/<platform>

       * Download mod_jserv for your platform from 

	   http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/tomcat/release/v1.0R1/<os>/<platform>/modules
  
         and copy it into /path/to/apache-1.3.9/modules.

       * Edit /path/to/apache-1.3.9/conf/httpd.conf and add the
         following line at the end:

           Include /path/to/tomcat1.0r1/etc/tomcat.conf

   2.3 Testing Your Configuration

       * Restart Apache (apachectl restart or Apache -k restart on Win32)

       * Make sure http://<hostname> is working

       * Try http://<hostname>/examples -- you should see the Tomcat
         examples. 

   2.3 Adding Contexts

       There's two different ways you can add contexts to this
       configuration: 

        (a) 
	    * Add to /path/to/tomcat1.0r1/etc/tomcat.conf: 
	    
	    	    ApJservMount /<context> /root

	    * restart Apache. 

	(b) 
	
	    * Create /path/to/apache-1.3.9/htdocs/<context>
	    
	    * Install all the files of that context into that
              directory.

	    * Make sure /path/to/tomcat1.0r1/server.xml points to
              /path/to/apache-1.3.9/htdocs/<context>

	    * Add to /path/to/tomcat1.0r1/etc/tomcat.conf:

	      ApJservMount /<context>/servlet /root 
	      <Location /CONTEXT/WEB-INF/ >
	           AllowOverride None
		   deny from all
	      </Location>

3. Tested Configurations


   Apache 1.3.9 + Tomcat 1.0 R1 has been tested on the following OSes: 

    * Linux (RedHat 6.1) on SPARC and Intel
    * Solaris 2.6 on SPARC
    * Windows NT SP 4

4. More information, feedback and bugs

   Please send bug reports (both on Tomcat and on this document) to
   tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org. 

   If you tested this on a platform/os that is not listed here, please
   either update this file (if you have CVS commit access on Jakarta)
   or send a note to tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org.

* assertArrayEquals(double[], double[], double) and assertArrayEquals(float[], float[], float)

* update documentation
	* new cook's tour
	* update Test Infected
* Should there be a "prefix" annotation for Suites?
  * This would allow two Suites with different BeforeClass/AfterClass behaviors,
    but the same component tests, to co-exist

* update the build process
    * automatically upload a new JAR
    * update site for plug-in version?
* Ant
	* Basic task
* support testing run once initialization code e.g. class Foo {{...}}
* Automatically add failing tests to the Known Defects section of the README.html

* Create test target in ant
* Organize org.junit.tests
* Create assume(that()) and assert(that()) 
  (what is a better name for the second one?)
  
* Simplify implementation of equality, and organize AssertionTest

* Theories class validation should be much better

* assumePasses doesn't have desired effect within a Theory

* Find a way to make Parameterized a single-class extension

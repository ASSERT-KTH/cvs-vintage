 <section name="What is Scarab?">

 <p>
    Scarab is an Artifact tracking system with the following feature set:
 </p>
 <ul>
    <li>A full feature set similar to those found in other Issue tracking
        systems: data entry, queries, reports, notifications to interested
        parties, collaborative accumulation of comments, dependency
        tracking</li>
    <li>In addition to the standard features, Scarab has fully
        customizable and unlimited numbers of
        Modules (your various projects),
        Issue types (Defect, Enhancement, Requirement, etc),
        Attributes (Operating System, Status, Priority, etc),
        Attribute options (P1, P2, P3) which can all be defined
        on a per Module basis so that each of your modules is
        configured for your specific tracking requirements.</li>
    <li>Built using Java Servlet technology for speed, scalability,
        maintainability, and ease of installation.</li>
    <li>Fully localized using java conform resource bundles. Many
        language integrations availabel (en,de,fr,ru,ko,ja,...)</li>
    <li>Import/Export ability via XML allowing for easy migration
        from other systems (e.g. Bugzilla).</li>
    <li>Modular code design that allows manageable modifications of
        existing and new features over time.</li>
    <li>Fully customizable through a set of administrative pages.</li>
    <li>Easily modified UI look and feel.</li>
    <li>Can be integrated into larger systems by re-implementing
        key interfaces.</li>
    <li>Is a ready to use issue management system</li>
 </ul>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Mailing Lists">
<p>To get involved with the development of Scarab, please 
join the developer's <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing you should send when you join the list is to post an
    introduction message that tells the group:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Who you are</li>
    <li>A link to a picture, if ya have one</li>
    <li>Your interest in Issue Tracking</li>
    <li>The role you would like to play in the project (e.g., do you want to just 
        discuss ideas, write code, do UI design, or be an early users?), and</li>
    <li>The rough level of effort you expect to put (e.g., mainly lurking, a few 
        postings a week, a few evenings, several hours a week, this is part of my 
        full-time job).</li>
</ul>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Getting Started">
<p>
The first place to start off with developing on Scarab is to download
the <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectSource">CVS tree</a>
and explore the documentation, build system and code that is there
already. Build a "target" sandbox, startup Tomcat and explore the
templates that are already there. Analyze the database design and look
at the files in the src/sql directory (the default-data and sample-data)
files are very helpful. The README.txt file documents everything
necessary to get a Scarab installation up and running. It's easy.
</p>

<subsection name="Submitting Issues">
<p>
After searching the issue tracker and you really do have an original problem to report, 
then please report it using our 
<a href="http://scarab.collab.net/">issue tracker</a>. Register and
create a new account. Make sure to request a DEVELOPER role. Please 
include a detailed message that describes the problem (make it as easy
as possible to understand), how to reproduce the problem and a stack
trace if one is generated.  Make sure the the email address you register with is
subscribed to the <a href="/mail-lists.html">issues</a> mailing list so that emails generated by Scarab are
properly sent to the mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE: Please do not use the issue tracker to create
test issues</strong>. You can use our <a href="http://www.saxess.com/en/components/scarab/testserver.page">runbox hosted by Saxess</a>
to create as many test issues as you want.
</p>

<p>
If the issue tracker is unavailable or you have a problem with it,
please contact <a href="mailto:dev@scarab.tigris.org">the developers</a>
and let them know.

      <question>
        How can I not load the Sample Data?
      </question>
      <answer>
There is a LoadOrder.lst file in src/sql that you should be able to
modify to get what you want.  Just remove the last file which is the
sample data.  If you don't want to modify the default LoadOrder.lst, you
can also specify a different file to use with -l or --loadorder option
to create-db.sh.

        Is there suitable 'propaganda' material that I could use in my company demo to try to convince my boss that it is a good idea to use Scarab?
      </question>
      <answer>
The website and use of Scarab itself are all we currently have.
Scarab is very easy to <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org/unbranded-source/browse/*checkout*/scarab/README.txt?rev=1">install and setup</a>, 
so it should not take you much time to become comfortable with 
Scarab so that you can perform your own demonstration.

        Is Scarab ready for production use?
      </question>
      <answer>
Scarab is in pre-1.0 beta. It has been in development for over
two years now and there is quite a lot of features in it. On
July 9th, 2002, we became self hosting. This means that we now
use Scarab to track Scarab so we feel it is ready enough for
usage. We also know that there are several large corporations
using Scarab. Please note that we do not promise anything. If
Scarab eats your database, then we hope you have good backups.

      <question>
        What are Scarab's disadvantages over Bugzilla?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>     
Scarab has many features and advantages over Bugzilla, which we
are not going to get into here, but the primary disadvantages are:
</p>

<p>
#1. implementation of workflow<br />
        This means that Scarab does not have any logic
        implemented within it that allows you to say things
        like: when the State is changed to closed, change the 
        resolution to resolved. There is an API for allowing
        this to happen, however, it has not been implemented
        in the Open Source version of Scarab yet. We are hoping
        that the community will implement this for us since 
        CollabNet is not making this part available at this time.
        
        <strong>Update: the beginnings of workflow have been checked
        into a branch of CVS by a member of our community. it is not
        complete, but it is a start.</strong>
</p>

<p>
#2. testing and deployment as wide as Bugzilla<br />
        Bugzilla has been deployed far and wide over a number
        of years and has undergone a great amount of testing
        and visibility on the Mozilla.org website. Scarab has 
        not had the same level of testing and usage.

    <faq id="5">
      <question>
        What problems might arise if I deploy Scarab now?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>
We have not heard of any major data integrity issues. In other words, we
have not heard of Scarab destroying its own database. However, we have
found several bugs along the way where things were not being logged
properly or other such annoyances.
</p>

<p>
We recommend strongly that you make regular backups of your database by
doing full dumps. That way, if something does go wrong, not only can you
send us a copy of your database (if appropriate) but you can also revert
to the previous state.
</p>

<p>
We provide database upgrade scripts for each revision of Scarab. That 
way you can be sure that if you start using Scarab now, you will be able
to forward migrate your data when there are Scarab updates. Please see
the upgrade instructions below for more information.
</p>

<p>
You may also run into various bugs or missing features within Scarab. It
is best to first search our <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/issues.html">issue database</a> and <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/unbranded-source/browse/*checkout*/scarab/KNOWN_ISSUES.txt?rev=1">KNOWN_ISSUES.txt</a> file to see if we know about the
issue. If not, please let us know by reporting it to the issue tracker.
Whatever you do, please don't send it to the mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
Remember, Scarab is still pre-1.0 beta software and is still under
heavy development.

      <question>
        Why am I getting an error connecting to MySQL?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>
From the <a
href="http://scarab.tigris.org/unbranded-source/browse/*checkout*/scarab/README.txt?rev=1">README.txt</a> file:
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If you get a 'Server configuration denies access to data source'
      or 'access denied' or 'Invalid authorization' or
      'java.lang.NullPointerException: Connection object was null.'
      error from MySQL in the log files, please read the MySQL
      documentation on how to fix this error. We will not provide
      support for this since it is really a MySQL configuration issue.
</p>

<p>
    Hint: On some operating systems, there seems to be a weird
    interation between the JVM, DNS resolution and the MySQL driver
    where a JDBC url pointing to 'localhost' will resolve as 
    'localhost.localdomain' and will prevent the connection to MySQL
    from authenticating correctly because most people configure MySQL
    for 'localhost'. One way to get around this is to use IP addresses
    in both the MySQL ACL as well as in the JDBC url.
</p>
<p>
      At least one person has reported that using '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost'
      resolved a 'Server configuration denies access to data source' connection issue.
</p>
<p>
      In order to setup the right permissions in MySQL, you may wish to
      try executing this command on a Unix command line (it has been
      reported to work for one person):
</p>

<p>
        echo "GRANT ALL ON scarab.* to ''@localhost" | mysql mysql
</p>
      
<p>
NOTE: Sometimes it may be useful to use "ant create-db" rather than "create-db.sh"
      to diagnose connection issues since ant uses jdbc and the same URL
      that Scarab does while running.

      problem:

      <question>
        How do I hook Scarab up to (or behind) Apache?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>
Here is my configuration for the 
<a href="http://scarab.collab.net/">Scarab Live Server</a>:
</p>

<pre>
NameVirtualHost 157.22.245.3
&lt;VirtualHost 157.22.245.3&gt;
    ServerName scarab.collab.net
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule /(.+) http://scarab.collab.net:8081/$1 [P]
    ProxyPassReverse / http://scarab.collab.net:8081/s/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The above might not be optimal or even correct, but it works for
me. You will need to have mod_rewrite and mod_proxy enabled on your
server. A 'faster' method of doing the same thing would be to use
Tomcat's mod_jk/mod_webapp with some rewrite rules (to get the short
url's), but I'm not doing that, so I don't have configuration to show
for it. Contributions welcome.
</p>

<p>
For hiding Scarab behind Apache SSL, a similar setup as above would
work, you would just want to make sure to listen to the https port 443
in the VirtualHost declaration.

      <question>
        How do I populate the database with my own issue types, attributes
and attribute options?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>
When you first install Scarab using the ./create-db.sh -e script,
you will get an empty database that is only populated with the
required data. Therefore, you will need to setup your installation
with new Modules, Issue types, Attributes and Attribute options.
</p>

<p>
Login as the Scarab Administer account that you created/defined
in your build.properties when you built Scarab.
</p>

<p>
#1. Create a new module.<br />
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage modules -> Create new module
</p>

<p>
#2. Select the module by clicking the 'Modules' link in the top-left
    of the screen.
</p>

<p>
#3. Now, create a new global issue type.<br />
    Admin -> Global -> Global issue types
</p>

<p>
#4. Add the new issue type to the module.<br />
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage issue types -> Create new
</p>

<p>
#5. Set the issue type to be active and shown in the left hand nav.<br />
    (should be the next screen after #4. if not, then it is:
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage issue types)
</p>

<p>
#6. Edit the issue type and create attributes and attribute options.<br />
    Admin -> Modules -> Manage issue types (click the issue type name).
</p>

<p>
#7. Add attributes to an attribute group.<br />
    (click the attribute group name on the 'Edit issue type' screen
    and then click the 'Add new' button. If there are no global attributes
    to add (most likely in this case), click the 'Create new' button to
    define a global attribute.)
</p>
    
<p>
#8. Defining an attribute and its options.<br />
    (Set the name/description/type of the attribute and then save it.
     If you have created a Dropdown list, then the ability to create
     attribute options will show up below. Simply add options and click
     Save. When you are done, click done and it will take you back to
     step #7. The attribute should also appear in the group.)
</p>

<p>
Continue to repeat the steps above until all of your issue types, attributes
and attribute options have been defined.

      <question>
        How do I setup Scarab so that it will send a copy of each issue
change to a particular email address (ie: a mailing list or the project leader)?
      </question>
      <answer>
As either the module administrator or the domain administrator user, go
to the Admin->Modules->Manage modules screen and edit the particular
module that you are interested in tracking issue changes in. Set the
'Archive email' address to the email address that you want. Please note, do
not try to do this in the Global module, only modules which are children of 
the Global module. If you want this email to go to multiple people, setup
a mailing list and subscribe the people to that mailing list and then
set the 'Archive email' address to be the address of the mailing list.

      <question>
       When I receive notification email from scarab, the url to the
       issue starts with http://localhost:8080/. Clearly that is bad because I
       want the email to point to the server that Scarab is on. How to I make
it say the server domain name instead?
      </question>
      <answer>
In order to have one fewer thing to have to configure, Scarab uses
whatever you type into the browser url as the url that is sent in the
emails. So, if your server name is foo.com, then going to
http://foo.com:8080/ instead of http://localhost:8080/ will generate the
right url in the emails.

        How can I set defaults for the various attributes on

      <answer>
Right now, that is what issue templates do. Click on the 'Templates'
link in the left hand side navigation, create the template and it will
then show up when you go to enter a new issue. You can create as many
templates as you wish and just 'apply' them when you enter a new issue.
A nice feature addition would be to have a setting on the template
administration screen that denotes which one should be automatically
applied.

      <question>
        What is the process for upgrading Scarab?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>      
The  Scarab developers provide MySQL database upgrade scripts
for each new version of Scarab. We also take contributions for other
databases. These scripts reside in the scarab/src/sql/upgrade directory.
Some of these scripts are .sql files and some are unix shell .sh files.
If you are using another database or operating system, we welcome your
contributions to port these files.
</p>

<p>
To execute the .sql scripts you should type something along the lines
of:
</p>

<p>
mysql DATABASE_NAME &lt; mysql-upgrade-1.0b8-1.0b9-1.sql
</p>

<p>
To execute the .sh scripts you should type something along the lines
of:
</p>

<p>
./mysql-upgrade-1.0b8-1.0b9-3.sh --password
</p>

<p>
Note that you will need to execute ALL of the scripts in order of
upgrade version number and script order. For example, if you are
upgrading from 1.0b8 to 1.0b9, then you should execute
mysql*b8*b9-1.sql, mysql*b8*b9-2.sql, etc. Also note that the --password
argument to the shell script is optional and not required if you do not
need to specify a password.
</p>

<p>
If you have deployed Scarab with the default settings and are running
out of the default target directory, then you should download the new
version of Scarab, move the target directory into the new version of
Scarab, cd into target/webapps/scarab/WEB-INF and backup and remove the
following directories: classes, conf, lib, sql, src. You should be
careful to not remove the indexes and attachments directories (if they
exist). Once you have done that, you can build Scarab again following
the directions in the README.txt file. You should take note to create a
~/build.properties file which stores your changes to the Scarab settings
so that when you build again, your settings remain intact.

      </question>
      <answer>
Alert! Sorry, the email you submitted (EMAIL) does not have a DNS A or MX record
defined. It is likely that the domain is invalid and that we cannot send
you email. Please see ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2505.txt for more
details. Please try another email address or contact your system
administrator.
<p>
Scarab has an optional feature which is enabled by setting the
scarab.register.email.checkRFC2505=true property in your
build.properties. This feature uses DNS to check that the domain which
is being registered has a valid A or MX record which is the minimum required
to send email to a domain name. This feature is enabled
to help try to prevent people from creating bogus accounts on the
server.

        I get a funny error when trying to run Scarab on Tomcat 4.1.x:
      </question>
      <answer>
<pre>
java.lang.VerifyError: (class:
org/apache/fulcrum/intake/transform/XmlToAppData, method: parseFile
signature:
(Ljava/lang/String;Z)Lorg/apache/fulcrum/intake/xmlmodel/AppData;)
Incompatible object argument for function call
</pre>

<p>
Tomcat has several directories setup in order to create different
'levels' of classpaths. There is a classpath that is specific to Tomcat
and a classpath that is shared by all of the webapplications that Tomcat
is running. Since Scarab still depends on Xerces 1.x, we need to make
sure that that is the only Xerces available to Scarab at runtime.
</p>

<p>
In order to make Scarab work with Tomcat 4.1.x, you will need to move
the xercesImpl.jar from tomcat/common/endorsed to tomcat/server/lib.
This makes it so that the Xerces 2.x that comes with Tomcat is only used
by Tomcat. You will also need to make sure that if you have any other
webapplications which depend on Xerces (1.x or 2.x), that they include a
copy of the .jar file in their WEB-INF/lib directory.
</p>

<p>
It is sad that this needs to be this way, but due to Xerces
incompatibility issues, that is the way it is. Note that we will
eventually make Scarab dependent on Xerces 2.x so that this is not an
issue, but we are not quite there yet.

        I see a lot of little temp files created on disk.
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>
The reason for this is because when you upload a file attachment, the
upload system also sends the form data. Because of this, each little bit
of data will get a file created for it. You can adjust the size of the
memory cache so that more of this data is held in temp memory (and not
created as files) with this property:
</p>

<pre>
# The maximum size of a request that will have it's elements cached in
# memory by TurbineUploadService class.
#
services.UploadService.size.threshold=8192
</pre>

<p>
These files should get cleaned up as the object is garbage collected, or
the Java Virtual Machine is shutdown. If they persist after a shutdown,
you can most likely safely remove them.

<question>
        Can running an import break my scarab instance?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>It shouldn't.  The way the scarab import works is that it first parses the 
passed xml to import to ensure all dependencies resolve, and that all modules, 
users, attributes and attribute options mentioned in the xml exist.  If any 
are missing, then the entire import fails and a report is produced listing the 
problems found ("No such user 'jon'", etc.).  If importing via the UI, the
error report shows in the result screen.  If importing via ant, check the
scarab-xmlimport.log file.  If the validation parse runs to the end w/o error,
then begins the insertion parse. 
</p>
<p>Note, the scarab validation parse mentioned above is
distinct from an xml validation parse: The latter checks the validity of the 
xml submitted, the former examines the data contained in the xml making sure
its coherent with respect to scarab.

testing.  The import of dependencies amongst issues works but it too is 
in need of testing, and has some limitations and requirements if included
as part of an initial issue import.

<question>
        Does import support the import of inter-issue dependencies?
      </question>
      <answer>
You cannot declare dependencies between separate scarab xml files being 
imported; dependencies can only be reliably established (that is, reconciled)
within a single xml import file. The way dependencies are done is that on 
import, after the validation parse and insert of issues, a dependency resolving
step runs: It 'decorates' the just inserted issues w/ the interdependencies 
mentioned in the xml (providing certain information, like activity-set id,
is correctly set between issues).  This step must happen after insert because 
in order to make the interdependencies, the actual scarab issue ids must
exist. At this time, it does not seem as though you can add dependencies 
via the xml import update mechanism.

<question>
        When would I start a new activity set?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>You'd start a new activity-set when: 
    <ol>
    <li>Importing an issue and its initial state.</li>
    <li>Adding physical attachments to an issue.</li>
    <li>Adding comments to an issue (Scarab treats attachments and comments as
        roughly equivalent).</li>
    <li>Adding an <i>activity</i> entry: e.g., one or more state changes such
        as 'Changed from NEW to STARTED', or issue dependencies.</li>

        How does workflow affect xml import?
      </question>
      <answer>
Workflow is disabled in the importing thread so there should be no 
 possibility for conflict.

<question>
        Why when I import is issue 'created-by' not respected?
      </question>
      <answer>
<p>What may be happening is that the activity-set id in your xml may be that
of an already existing activity-set; you may be picking up the 'created-by'
of the activity-set that already exists in scarab.  Ensure your activity-set
id is definetly not that of an already existing activity-set in scarab.
This section from the scarab.dtd is pertinent:
<pre>
    The activity-set id passed is checked against the db to see if
    this activity-set already exists (The activity-set id 
    == SCARAB_TRANSACTION.TRANSACTION_ID).  If the activity-set id
    does not refer to an already-existing activity-set, a new
    activity-set id is created by taking the next id off the top of 
    auto-incrementing sequence; the passed activity-set id is
    discarded.  If an activity-set w/ the passed id already exists,
    then we'll use the already-existing activity-set during import of
    this activity-set's activites. To avoid picking up an extant
    activity-set unintentionally on import, i.e. in the case where
    you are doing an import of all new issues w/ no desire to refer
    to already existing activity-sets, do not use a purely numerical
    id for your activity-set id: Give the activity-set an alphabetic 
    prefix.  In other words, instead of using numeric ids like 
    1,2,3,4,5, use ids that run new1, new2, new3, etc.

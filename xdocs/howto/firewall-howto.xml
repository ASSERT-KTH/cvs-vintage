<section name="The solution (for unix/linux based servers)">
<p>
<pre>
1.) Add a "webspace" to your company webserver.
     for apache the simplest way is as follows:

     Add following two lines to your server conf,
     e.g. within your virtual host config:

     ProxyPass        /scarab http://ScarabHost:8080/scarab
     ProxyPassReverse /scarab http://ScarabHost:8080/scarab

     You need to adjust the host:port settings to your environment.
     I also assume, you have mod_proxy added in your apache
     configuration.
     You can attach scarab in multiple ways to your webserver,
     but this is by far the easiest approach...

2.) Setup your "build.properties" for scarab as follows:

     The following build properties are essential. You might
     want to change others too. Please follow the instructions
     in the scarab-installation manual and adjust the values below
     according to your environment:

     scarab.context=scarab
     scarab.http.domain=www.yourCompany.com
     scarab.http.port=80
     scarab.email.domain=yourCompany.com
     scarab.tomcat.port=8080
     scarab.tomcat.proxy.name="www.yourCompany.com"
     scarab.tomcat.proxy.port="80"

     Note: The trick is to set scarab.http.port to 80, NOT to 8080
     The other trick is to surround the proxy settings with double quotes

3.) build scarab as described in thje installation manual

4.) go to target/conf/server.xml
     check that you have the following lines:
    			<source>
<![CDATA[
     <Connector className="org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector"
                port="9023" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
                enableLookups="true" redirectPort="8443"
                acceptCount="10" debug="0" connectionTimeout="60000"
                proxyName="www.yourCompany.com"
                proxyPort="80" />
]]>
				</source>

     Sometimes the scarab build drops these (erroneous) lines instead:
    			<source>
<![CDATA[
     <Connector className="org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector"
                port="9023" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
                enableLookups="true" redirectPort="8443"
                acceptCount="10" debug="0" connectionTimeout="60000"
                "www.yourCompany.com"
                "80" />
]]>
				</source>
     Note: proxyPort and proxyName are missing. Correct this manually if
     necessary.


5.) build the database as described in the installation manual.
     If you already have a database, skip this point.

     cd $root/src/sql
     ./create-db.sh


6.) (re-)start scarab

     cd target/bin
     ./catalina.sh start

7.) restart your webserver


Now you can access your scarab from

	http://www.yourCompany.com/scarab/issues

from within your intranet AND from the internet.

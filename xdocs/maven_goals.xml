        <tr><th>Goal</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr>
          <td>war:inplace</td>
          <td>
            Compiles all the Scarab docs into /src/webapp/ so that you can do inplace development of Scarab.  You do need to compile the Torque OM objects first via running "ant" in the /build directory.
            Unit tests are NOT run as part of this goal.
          </td>
        </tr>  
        <tr>
          <td>scarab:clean</td>
          <td>
            Does an extensive clean of directories.  Cleans out any work files generated by Tomcat in /tomcat, deletes /src/webapp/WEB-INF/classes and /src/webapp/WEB-INF/conf, and otherwise returns the source tree to normal.
          </td>
        </tr>          
        <tr>
          <td>scarab:sample</td>
          <td>
            Produces a Windows .exe installable version of Scarab with an embedded Tomcat and Hypersonic Database.  This is meant as a quick resource for people to use to get started with Scarab.  Compiles everything to /target/dist.  Requires that you have <a href="http://nsis.sf.net">NSIS</a> installed.
          </td>
        </tr>            
        <tr>
          <td>scarab:deploy_docs_head</td>
          <td>
            Runs "maven site" and then copies all the resulting files to ${scarab.docs.head}.  It does some regular expression replacing on dates in the documentation to reduce the number of changes that need to be committed into Scarab Gen.  Theorectically running this goal twice means the second time you won't have to commit any changes!
          </td>
        </tr>                          
        <tr>
          <td>scarab:fix_linefeeds</td>
          <td>
            Changes all CRLF's in the source to just LF, and removes any DOS eof characters.
          </td>
        </tr>

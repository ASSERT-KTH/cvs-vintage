compile with:

javac org/columba/main/Main.java -classpath .:./ext/parser.jar:./ext/jaxp.jar

javac org/columba/gui/themes/*.java

javac org/columba/gui/themes/thincolumba/*.java

javac org/columba/gui/themes/contrastcolumba/*.java



start with:

try to use the run.sh script

watch out: this script has to be made executable with the chmod u+x command...




or try it manually:

java org/columba/main/Main


if this does not work:

Most of the time java was not able to find the classes from package org.w3c..
If this happens you have to add these packages to the classpath.
They reside in the ext directory.

try this command:

java -cp .:./ext/jaxp.jar:./ext/parser.jar org/columba/main/Main

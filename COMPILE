use the compile script:

./compile.sh

watch out: this script has to be made executable with the chmod u+x command...


compile it manually:

javac org/columba/main/Main.java -classpath .:./ext/parser.jar:./ext/jaxp.jar

javac org/columba/gui/themes/*.java

javac org/columba/gui/themes/thincolumba/*.java

javac org/columba/gui/themes/contrastcolumba/*.java

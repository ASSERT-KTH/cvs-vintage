You need Ant to compile Columba (http://ant.apache.org).

o Building Columba on Unix/Linux type operating systems:
  bash# ant
  
  Running Columba using JDK1.4:
  bash# chmod 0775 run_source.sh
  bash# run_source.sh

  (The "chmod" command is used to make the run_source.sh script executable.
   Alternatively, you can also start the script using "sh run_source.sh".)
  
o Building Columba on Windows type operating systems:
  shell# ant
  
  Running Columba using JDK1.4:
  shell# run_source.bat

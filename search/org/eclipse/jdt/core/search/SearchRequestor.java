/**
 * A <code>SearchRequestor</code> collects search results from a <code>search</code>
 * query to a <code>SearchEngine</code>. Clients must implement this interface and pass
 * an instance to the <code>search(...)</code> methods. When a search starts, the <code>aboutToStart()</code>
 * method is called, then 0 or more call to <code>accept(...)</code> are done, finally the
 * <code>done()</code> method is called.
 * <p>
 * Results provided to this collector may be accurate - in this case they have an <code>EXACT_MATCH</code> accuracy -
 * or they might be potential matches only - they have a <code>POTENTIAL_MATCH</code> accuracy. This last
 * case can occur when a problem prevented the <code>SearchEngine</code> from resolving the match.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The order of the results is unspecified. Clients must not rely on this order to display results, 
 * but they should sort these results (for example, in syntactical order).
 * <p>
 * The <code>SearchRequestor</code> is also used to provide a progress monitor to the 
 * <code>SearchEngine</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.

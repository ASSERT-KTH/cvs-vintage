NOTE: This document is the first cut at a release plan for the next
dot release of Tomcat. Nothing in this document should be

on the TOMCAT-DEV mailing list.



			Tomcat 3.3 Release Plan 
			=======================

Objective: 

    The objective of the proposed 3.3 release is to complete the development 
    of jakarta-tomcat 3.x  and achieve the stated goals of providing a 
    production quality 2.2/1.1 servlet container. 

Goals:

    The following goals should be met in executing this plan:

    1. No regressions compared with 3.2. 

    2. Fixing the bugs found after and during 3.2 release cycle. 

    3. Full review of the code, making sure the modularity and 
       extensibility goals have been achieved.
  
    4. Make sure that the refactoring is clean, and maintainance will be
       easier that 3.2

    5. Ensure that the performance is (significantly) better than
       3.2

Tomcat 3.3 Milestone 1 Release:

	Code Freeze/Tag Date:	Feb 1, 2001 (?)
	Release Manager:	???

    The build must pass all watchdog and all existing test suites. It should
    work on both JDK1.1 and JDK1.2. 

    After the build of Milestone 1, work should start in reviewing all the 
    classes and interfaces in tomcat.core, and any feedback should be 
    discussed and incorporated. Also, the documentation will be reviewed 
    and improved. 
    
    In paralel, work will start on fixing a significant number ( most ? ) of 
    bugs that were reported  and fixed in 3.2 and post 3.2. This work will
    continue during the beta period.

    Whenever possible, we should try to create a self-test case ( using
    the current self-test application and GTest ).
    More documentations should be added on running GTest and simplify the
    test application. 

Tomcat 3.3 BiWeekly milestones:
    
    After the first milestone, we will periodically build milestones in
    order to track the evolution. ( see also the testing plan at the end ).

Tomcat 3.3 Beta:

	Code Freeze/Tag Date:	March 15, 2001 (?)
	Release Manager:	???

     No major change will be done after the Beta is build without a 
     vote. 

     No major bug ( spec compliance or stability ) should be open in order to
     enter beta.

     During the beta period we will fix all remaining bugs and run the manual
     tests for the bugs that have no automated test case.

Tomcat 3.3 Final Release

	Code Freeze Date:	Apr 5, 2001 (?)
	Release Manager:	???

    The final build. The pre-requisite for the release is having no bugs in
    the test suite, resolution for all known bugs and aproval by the community.
    

Release criteria
================

Given that this will be proposed as the final release of tomcat3.x the 
standards of quality and testing will be significantly higher than in
 previous releases. 

1. Tomcat 3.3 should have no regression compared with 3.2. 
Any reported regression is a show-stopper and a release can't be made
before it is resovled. 

2. Open bugs should be resolved.

3. Tomcat 3.3 should be tested with existing, complex applications  ( cocoon, 
 bugrat, etc ).

Platorms.
 We must make sure that tomcat is tested ( at least watchdog + self-test )
with at least Linux, Solaris, Windows 9x, Windows NT/2000. 

JDK.
 We must test tomcat with at least JDK1.1 and Java2 (multiple versions if 
 possible) . The tests should also include a stress test ( a high load
 "ab" running for a long time )

Configurations
 Tomcat must be tested standalone, with Apache 1.3, Apache 2.0 and
( possibly ) with IIS and NES ( low priority ).


Maintainance Plan
=================

After tomcat 3.3 is released, no major development should go on into the main
branch. 

The release team should consist of at least 3 people, and will fix any major
bugs that will be found after the 3.3 release, and propose to the group
minor releases, if absolutely needed ( security or stability bugs ).
In any case, no backward-incompatible or major changes should be made.

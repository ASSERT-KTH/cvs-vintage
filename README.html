<h3>Installation</h3>

The distribution only includes a batchfile to compile the java files. There
currently is no makefile or other script for that purpose.
<p>
To run the applets doesn't require any further installation steps.
Refer to the <a href=documentation/samples.html>samples</a> to view the sample
applets.
<p>
To run the sample applications you should include the JHotDraw directory
in your CLASSPATH. <b>Note</b> using a relative path to refer to JHotDraw
can result in class loading errors. You run into this problem when the application's
working directory is changed with a file dialog.
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
To get started check out the <a href=documentation/samples.html>samples</a> and
the <a href=documentation/documentation.html>documentation</a> delivered with
JHotDraw.

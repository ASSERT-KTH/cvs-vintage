       <!-- MxInterceptor to enable JMX monitoring.
            
            options are :
            
            type : HTTP or JRMP adaptor (default http)
            
            port : http/jrmp adaptor will listen to this port
            
            If you're using the MX4J HTTP Adaptor, you could also 
            set host and authentication :
            
            host : the MX4J http adaptor will listen to this IP/host
            
            authentication: the MX4J http adaptor will use HTTP authentication
                            method which could be (none, basic, digest)
            
            user: set the user to be entered when asking for user/password in
                  HTTP authentication.
                  
            password : define the password for HTTP authentication
            
            Note, if you're using a JMX console, you don't have to 
            use the http adaptor

=============================================================================
1.  INTRODUCTION

StreamHandler is an add-on module for Tomcat 3.3(a) and later (i.e Tomcat
3.3.x versions).  The purpose of this add-on module is to register a
URLStreamHandlerFactory that:

    1. Loads defined handlers from the ContextClassLoader.  This allows
       handlers from the web application's classloader to be used by
       the factory.

    2. Returns a SteamHandler that doesn't support connections for protocols
       that don't have a defined handler.  This allows for URL manipulation.


=============================================================================
2.  INSTALLATION

To install simply place the StreamHandler.war in Tomcat's "modules"
directory.  When Tomcat is started, this War file will be expanded and the
StreamHandler module defined in the WEB-INF/interceptor.xml file will be
added to the server.  This allows it to participate in how Tomcat behaves.

Please see doc/mod_jk-howto.html for more verbose instructions

* What is web-connector ?

web-connector is a new project to release web-servers connector
for the jakarta Tomcat servlet engine.

This project didn't start from null since it reuse the latest code from
mod_jk for the native parts and tomcat 3.3 for the java side of the 
force.

From mod_jk we gain :

* A connector (plugin) for many Web Server, including
  Apache HTTP Server, Netscape/IPLanet NES and Microsoft IIS
  It also support JNI (and seems to used at least by IBM under 
  AS/400 for Apache/WebSphere connectivity).
  
* Fault-tolerance and load-balancing. mod_jk use the concept of 
  workers which handle a particular request, and a special worker
  , the lb worker, is a group (cluster ?) of physical workers.

* Direct access to Tomcat 3.2/3.3 servlet engine via ajp12/ajp13
  protocol. 

* OK, then how do I build web-connector ?

For Unix:

Change to the apache1.3 or apache2.0 directory,
depending on which version of Apache you are running.

Execute "./build-unix.sh"  This script sets some environment variables
and then calls Apache's apxs script to do the actual compile.

If this doesn't work, please check the source for build-unix.sh.  You
may have to edit some variables.

Alternately, you may have more luck with the makefiles.  Execute them
with e.g. "make -f Makefile.linux mod_jk.so"

For Windows:

[need more info feel free to contact me]

* How do I install mod_jk.so?

Copy mod_jk.so into your APACHE_HOME/libexec

Add the following line to APACHE_HOME/conf/httpd.conf.  Replace
"TOMCAT_HOME" with the actual directory name.

   Include TOMCAT_HOME/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto

That's it!

When Tomcat starts, it automatically writes out mod_jk.conf-auto based
on your server.xml settings.  If this is inadequate for your needs,
you can copy mod_jk.conf-auto to a new file called "mod_jk.conf" and
then change httpd.conf to read

   Include TOMCAT_HOME/conf/mod_jk.conf

Note that Tomcat must be started *before* Apache for mod_jk to
initialize correctly.  Since "tomcat.sh start" launches Tomcat in the
background, you may have to do something like the following in your
startup script:

	cd $TOMCAT_HOME/bin
	./tomcat.sh start
	sleep 4
	$APACHE_HOME/bin/apachectl start

[Note: apachectl should be run as root, but Tomcat should be run as a
local user; this means that the above script would lead to a security
problem. Any suggestions to fix?]

* Where do I report bugs/errors?
 
See http://jakarta.apache.org/getinvolved/mail.html and
http://jakarta.apache.org/bugs/index.html for information.

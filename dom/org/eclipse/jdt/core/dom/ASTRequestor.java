/**
 * An AST requestor feeds compilation units to 
 * <code>ASTParser.createASTs</code>
 * and accepts the ASTs that arise from parsing them.
 * All of the compilation units must be from the same project.
 * The requestor is passed ASTs for not only the compilation units
 * it asks for, but also any other ones in the same project that
 * also needed to be parsed in the course of resolving bindings.
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>requestor.getSources() is called to find out what
 * compilation units to parse</li>
 * <li>requestor.acceptAST(ASTNode) is called several times,
 * for each compilation unit in the original list, and perhaps
 * for other compilation units in the same project</li>
 * <li>requestor.getSources() is called again to find out whether
 * there are additional compilation units to parse</li>
 * <li>the last 2 steps are repeated until getSources()
 * returns null</li>
 * </ul> 
 * Note that all the compilation units involved must be from
 * the same project, and can only be processed once.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be subclassed by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this API is under development and subject to change without notice.
 * </p>
 *

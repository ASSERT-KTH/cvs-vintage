to track outstanding issues for the ongoing development of<br>

<div align="center"><h1>Action Items List for Jakarta Tomcat</h1></div>

<p>This document is a living list of the action items related to the
current and future development of the Tomcat servlet container.  As such,
it focuses primarily on enhancements to existing features, as well as the
addition of new features.  Bugs in the implementation of existing features
should be reported to
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bugs">http://jakarta.apache.org/bugs</a>
so that they can be tracked and fixed.  The columns in this report contain
the following information:
<ul>
<li><b>Priority</b> - A sense of how important the Tomcat development
    community feels it is to address this issue in the short term.</li>
<li><b>Release</b> - The interim or final release (such as <code>3.3m2</code>)
    for which this action item is scheduled to be completed.</li>
<li><b>Action Item</b> - Concise description of the action item
    to be completed.</li>
<li><b>Volunteers</b> - Names and EMAIL addresses of those developers who
    have volunteered to assist in the design, implementation, testing, and
    documentation of this action item's changes to Tomcat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additions to, subtractions from, and changes to the action items listed
here should be discussed and approved on the TOMCAT-DEV mailing list, as
described on the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/guidelines/decisions.html">Decision
Making</a> page on the Jakarta Project web site.  Developers can nominate
themselves to work on particular action items by asking a Committer to add
their name and EMAIL address to those items.  The developers working on each
item should discuss and agree upon the approach to be used for implementing
the item's changes to the project source code and documentation, prior to
completing those changes.  Such discussions should take place on the
TOMCAT-DEV mailing list so that everyone can stay apprised of what is going
on, or chime in if they want to contribute ideas and suggestions.

<p>At various points in time, particular action items will be selected
and assigned to a particular interim release of Tomcat (based on lazy consensus
on the TOMCAT-DEV mailing list).  At that time, the assigned release will be
recorded in this document, and the item will be listed under that release in
the current <a href="RELEASE-PLAN-3.3">RELEASE-PLAN</a> schedule.

<p>For convenience, the action items have been organized into general
categories, which are presented in alphabetical order.  The following
categories of actions are currently identified:
<ul>
<li><a href="#Architecture">Architecture</a> of major Tomcat components
<li><a href="#Administration">Administration</a> application and tools
<li><a href="#Connectors">Connectors</a> to web servers and HTTP clients
<li><a href="#Containers">Containers</a> in the Tomcat core engine
<li><a href="#JSP">JSP</a> functionality enhancements
<li><a href="#Performance">Performance</a> improvements
<li><a href="#Release">Release</a> preparation items
<li><a href="#Future">Ideas</a> for the future
</ul>

Overview:

dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java.  It supports all defined record
types (including the DNSSEC types), and unknown types.  It can be used for
queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates.  It includes a cache which can be
used by clients, and an authoritative only server.  It supports TSIG
authenticated messages, partial DNSSEC verification, and EDNS0.  It is fully
thread safe.  It can be used to replace the native DNS support in Java.

dnsjava was started as an excuse to learn Java.  It was useful for testing new
features in BIND without rewriting the C resolver.  It was then cleaned up and
extended in order to be used as a testing framework for DNS interoperability
testing.  The high level API and caching resolver were added to make it useful
to a wider audience.  The authoritative only server was added as proof of
concept.


Getting started:

Run 'ant' from the toplevel directory to build dnsjava (a Makefile is also
provided, but does not have all of the features of the ant script).  JDK 1.4
or higher is required.

To compile name service provider support (org.xbill.DNS.spi), run 'ant spi'.


Replacing the standard Java DNS functionality:

Beginning with Java 1.4, service providers can be loaded at runtime.  To load
the dnsjava service provider, build it as explained above and set the system
property:

	sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.1=dns,dnsjava

This instructs the JVM to use the dnsjava service provide for DNS at the
highest priority.


Testing dnsjava:

Matt Rutherford <rutherfo@cs.colorado.edu> contributed a number of unit
tests, which are in the tests subdirectory.  The hierarchy under tests
mirrors the org.xbill.DNS classes.  To build the unit tests, run
'ant compile_tests', and to run then, run 'ant run_tests'.  The tests require
JUnit (http://www.junit.org) to be installed.

Some high-level test programs are in org/xbill/DNS/tests.


Limitations:

There's no way to determine what the local nameserver is at runtime from within
the JVM.  First, the property 'dns.server' (a comma delimited list) is
checked.  These can either be IP addresses or hostnames (which are resolved
using Java's built in DNS support).  If the underlying OS is unix-based, the
dnsjava package can parse /etc/resolv.conf and determine the nameservers.  If
the underlying OS is Windows, winipcfg/ipconfig can be called and the output
parsed.  Note that this may fail for some non-English versions of Windows.
Otherwise, or if these attempts fail, the default nameserver is
"localhost".  This is unavoidable.  Unfortunately, I have no idea how to
determine the nameserver for any other OSes.  Contributions of code
are welcome (see org/xbill/DNS/ResolverConfig.java for the basic structure).

The underlying platform must use an ASCII encoding of characters.  This means
that dnsjava will not work on OS/390, for example.


Additional documentation:

Javadoc documentation is provided in the doc/ subdirectory of binary
distributions, and can be built with 'ant docs'.

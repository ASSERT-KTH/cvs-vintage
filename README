 Columba is a full-featured Java EMail-Client. 
 It runs on every platform supporting Java. 

 For the latest information on new releases, website or ressource changes, 
 please visit http://columba.sourceforge.net



 This is a unstable release (beta stage). That means:
  - it will embarass you in front of your friends
  - it will crash
  - it won't work
 BUT:
  - it is simply the best mail client on this planet ;-)
  - it will work most of the time 
  - it is free



 
 WINDOWS:
  To run Columba with MS Windows doubleclick the "run.bat" file.
  
  

 LINUX/ UNIX FLAVORS:
  Try the run.sh script: "sh run.sh"


 OTHERS:
  "java -jar columba.jar"



 You need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Version 1.4/1.3 to run Columba.

 JDK1.3 users should consider taking a look in README_JDK1.3

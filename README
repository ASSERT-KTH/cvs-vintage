			Tomcat Servlet Container
			========================


This subproject contains the source code for the Tomcat servlet container (and
JSP engine) that conforms to the Java Servlet API Specification (version 2.2)
and the JavaServer Pages Specificaton (version 1.1).


Installing and Building Tomcat
==============================

In order to successfully build Tomcat, you will need to do the following.
In the instructions below, $JAKARTA_HOME (subsitute %JAKARTA_HOME% for
Windows systems) is assumed to be the directory into which you are installing
all of the required distributions.

* Download and install a version 1.1 or later Java Development Kit
  implementation for your operating system platform.  Set a "JAVA_HOME"
  environment variable to point at the directory where your JDK is installed,
  and add "$JAVA_HOME/bin" ("%JAVA_HOME%\bin" for Windows) to your PATH.
  Configure the CLASSPATH environment variable as well, if required.

* Download the Ant version 1.3 binary distribution from
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/v1.3/bin> and install
  it in the $JAKARTA_HOME directory.  Set an "ANT_HOME" environment variable
  to point to $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-ant-1.3.  If you are using Windows 9x,
  you should set ANT_HOME using DOS 8.3 names.  Also, add "$ANT_HOME/bin"
  (%ANT_HOME%/bin for Windows) to your PATH.

* Download JAXP version 1.0.1 from <http://java.sun.com/xml> and install it
  in the $JAKARTA_HOME directory.

* If you want to include SSL support, download the Java Secure Sockets
  Extension (JSSE) implementation (current version number is 1.0.2) from
  <http://java.sun.com/products/jsse> and install it into $JAKARTA_HOME.

* Download the source distribution archive of Tomcat 3.3 and expand it
  in the $JAKARTA_HOME directory.  It will expand using a base directory named
  "jakarta-tomcat-3.3", or something similar indicating the release.  If a
  different directory is used, substitute its name for "jakarta-tomcat-3.3"
  in the commands below.  You can now build an "unpacked" version of Tomcat
  (builds quicker because no time is spent JARing up results) by executing
  the following commands:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3
        ant

  This version can be executed as follows:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/build/tomcat
	./bin/startup.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\startup		<-- Windows

  and it can be shut down as follows:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/build/tomcat
	./bin/shutdown.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\shutdown		<-- Windows

* You can also build a binary distribution version of Tomcat as follows:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat
        ant dist

  This will create a binary distribution in
  "$JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/dist/tomcat" that is equivalent
  (in file arrangement) to the binary distribution releases of Tomcat 3.3
  that can be downloaded from the Jakarta web site at
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html>.

* You can delete the generated files in the "build/tomcat" and "dist/tomcat"
  directories by executing the following:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3
        ant clean


Running the Build
=================

You can run the "unpacked" version of Tomcat as follows:

* To start Tomcat, execute the following commands:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/build/tomcat
	./bin/startup.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\startup		<-- Windows

* You can now access the default web pages from a web browser at URL:

	http://localhost:8080

* To stop Tomcat, execute the following commands:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/build/tomcat
	./bin/shutdown.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\shutdown		<-- Windows

You can run the "distribution" version of Tomcat as follows:

* To start Tomcat, execute the following commands:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/dist/tomcat
	./bin/startup.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\startup		<-- Windows

* You can now access the default web pages from a web browser at URL:

	http://localhost:8080

* To stop Tomcat, execute the following commands:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/dist/tomcat
	./bin/shutdown.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\shutdown		<-- Windows

Alternatively, you can run Tomcat without changing your current working
directory, by setting the TOMCAT_HOME environment variable to point at the
Tomcat files you have built (for example, at directory
"$JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/build/tomcat" or
"$JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/dist/tomcat").  Now, you can start Tomcat
as follows:

	$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh	<-- Unix
	%TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\startup	<-- Windows

and shut it down likewise:

	$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh	<-- Unix
	%TOMCAT_HOME%\bin\shutdown	<-- Windows

Tomcat may be run with any XML parser that is compliant with the Java API for
XML Parsing specification.  Parsers known to successfully run Tomcat include:

  * The JAXP reference implementation (version 1.0 or later), which can be
    downloaded from <http://java.sun.com/xml>.  JAXP version 1.0.1 is
    included in the Tomcat binary distribution.

  * The Xerces parser (version 1.1.2 or later), which can be downloaded
    from <http://xml.apache.org>.  Make sure that the "xerces.jar" replaces
    jaxp.jar and parser.jar in Tomcat's lib/container directory.


Testing the Build
=================

Tomcat includes a "test" web application with some quick tests to exercise
the various parts of the Tomcat container.  This test is not built by
default.  To add the "test" web application to your "unpackaged" build,
execute:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3
	ant sanity-test

To add the "test" web application to the distribution build, execute:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3
	ant test.war

Before you can run the test, you must set the Admin web application to
"trusted". This can be accomplished by executing the following:

	cd $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/build/tomcat	<-- Unix
	./bin/tomcat.sh run -enableAdmin

	cd %JAKARTA_HOME%\jakarta-tomcat-3.3\build\tomcat	<-- Windows
	bin\tomcat run -enableAdmin

Next, start Tomcat with: 

	./bin/startup.sh	<-- Unix
	bin\startup		<-- Windows

To run the test, invoke the following URL in your browser:

	http://localhost:8080/admin/test/test.jsp

and then click "Submit Query".  The build targets for the Ant based test
script are then listed and the tests executed.  After the tests are
completed, the results will appear with "FAILED Tests" listed first,
followed the "PASSED Tests". This same procedure will also work with the
binary distribution which is created in
"$JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-tomcat-3.3/dist/tomcat".

For security reasons, after you are done with the test, you should either
restore the Admin web application to the default "untrusted" state, or change
the password for the "admin" user. To restore the Admin web application to
the default "untrusted" state, change trusted="true" to trusted="false" in
the "apps-admin.xml" file found in Tomcat's "conf" directory. If you want to
leave the Admin web application as "trusted, you should change the password
for the "admin" user in the "admin-users.xml" file located in Tomcat's
"conf/users" directory.

You can also use the Watchdog compatibility test suite, also available at
<http://jakarta.apache.org>, to test Tomcat's compliance to the servlet and
JSP specifications.



Before Committing Changes
=========================

Before committing any changes to the Tomcat CVS repository, you MUST do a
"build clean" followed by a "build dist" to ensure that the build process runs
cleanly, and you must ensure that the tests run correctly.

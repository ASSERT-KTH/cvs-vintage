dnsjava v0.1

Overview:

This is a simple implementation of DNS in Java.  It supports all of the common
record types and the DNSSEC types.  It can be used for queries, zone
transfers, and dynamic updates.

This was started as an excuse to learn Java.  It was useful for testing TSIG
support in BIND without rewriting the C resolver.  It was then cleaned up and
extended in order to be used as a testing framework for the DNS
interoperability testing at the 44th IETF.

dnsjava is far from complete.  It should support the rest of the record types,
even though most are deprecated and/or rarely used.  It should handle
exceptions in more places, and probably define exception of its own.  It should
be better documented.


Usage:

The dig client looks more or less like dig:
	dig @server name type [class] [-p port]

The update program is well documented; run 'help' from the command line.


Future:

- A GUI for the dynamic update program would be nice
- A basic (primary, caching, non-recursive) server wouldn't be too hard.
  dnsServer.java & dnsZone.java contain part of a server, but it's not
  done yet.

How to Build
------------

There are a 2 compilation scripts provided, a ksh based script for
Unix and a .bat based DOS build script. Essentially these scripts are
wrappers that put the ant.jar file on the classpath and calls:

	java com.sun.ant.Main

To build, execute the following command in this directory:

	build

This will build Tomcat into a build directory located in this directory.

Windows Note: If you get an "Out of Environment Space" message, you
need to up the initial environment of your command prompt window.

To build a 'distribution' build (without the tests, and with all the
classes jarred up nice) execute:

	build dist

To clean out the build (removes the build dir):

	build clean


Running the Build
-----------------

Two scripts are provided for starting and stopping the server. To
start the server:

	cd build
	cd tomcat
	startserver

To stop the server:

	stopserver


Testing the Build
-----------------

We have started a set of 'quick tests' that test out various parts of
Tomcat. In order to build and run tests, do the following:

	build test
	cd test
	runtests


BEFORE COMMITTING CHANGES
-------------------------

You must, MUST do a `build clean;build` to make sure a clean
workspace builds. Also, you must, MUST run the tests. All tests must
pass before checking in code. Yes, we just started adding tests, but
as time goes on, this will be our sanity check.

This is not a MUST for changes to Java code but if you modify .bat or
sh scripts you MUST make sure that it atleast builds on Solaris, and
Windows NT.

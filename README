PROJECT TOMCAT SOURCE TREE (AKA JSDK + JSP)
===========================================

This is the source code tree for Tomcat, the next generation Java(tm)
Servlet and JavaServer Pages Reference Implementation.

How to Build
------------

There are a 2 compilation scripts provided, a ksh based script for
Unix and a .bat based DOS build script. Essentially these scripts are
wrappers that put the ant.jar file on the classpath and calls:

	java com.sun.ant.Main

To build, execute the either of the following commands in this
directory:

	(unix)% compile
	(dos)> doscompile

This will build Tomcat into a build directory located in this directory.

Windows Note: If you get an "Out of Environment Space" message, you
need to up the initial environment of your command prompt window.

To build a 'distribution' build (without the tests, and with all the
classes jarrd up nice) execute:

	(unix)% compile dist
	(dos)> doscompile dist

To clean out the build (removes the build dir):

	(unix)% compile clean
	(dos)> doscompile clean

Running the Build
-----------------

Two scripts are provided for starting and stopping the server. To
start the server:

	(unix)% compile
	(unix)% cd build
	(unix)% startserver

	(dos)> compile
	(dos)> cd build
	(dos)> startsvr

To stop the server:

	(unix)% stopserver
	(dos)> stopsvr

Testing the Build
-----------------

We have started a set of 'quick tests' that test out various parts of
Tomcat. In order to build and run tests, do the following:

	(dos)> compile test
	(dos)> cd test
	(dos)> runtests

	(unix)% compile test
	(unix)% cd test
	(unix)% runtests


BEFORE COMMITTING CHANGES
-------------------------

You must, MUST do a `compile clean;compile` to make sure a clean
workspace builds. Also, you must, MUST run the tests. All tests must
pass before checking in code. Yes, we just started adding tests, but
as time goes on, this will be our sanity check.

dnsjava v0.0
Brian Wellington (bwelling@anomaly.munge.com)

This is a simple implementation of DNS in Java.  It supports all of the common
record types and the DNSSEC types.  It was written so that I could learn Java,
and so that I could test TSIG support in BIND without rewriting the resolver.

This is far from complete.  It should support the rest of the record types.  It
should handle exceptions in more places.  It should be better documented.  The
APIs should be improved.  EDNS should be added.  One day, all of this might
happen.

There are other things I'd like to do at some point.  A GUI for the dynamic
update program would be nice, since dynamic update can be pretty complex.
A basic (primary, caching, non-recursive) server wouldn't be too hard.

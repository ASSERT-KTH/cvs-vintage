It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/issues.html>

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle database creation to a fresh schema fails when ant tries
    to delete non-existent tables prior to creating them.

#2. You may still have some problems working with Oracle. Please let
    us know if you encounter anything, however, we don't promise to
    fix it right away unless you send real patches that conform to
    our desire to have transparent cross database support (ie: don't
    send us Oracle specific changes).

#3. XML import/export is completely unstable and not fully
    implemented. Don't count on it working 100% until 1.0.

#4. There is the possibility that the code surrounding the activity
    and transactions (ie: issue history) is not completely fleshed
    out and debugged.

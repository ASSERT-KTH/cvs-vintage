It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/>

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle import of the scarab-default-data.sql file will fail
    with some date formatting issues. There is lots of discussion on
    the mailing list about how to fix this. Read the archives.

#2. You may still have some problems working with Oracle. Please let
    us know if you encounter anything, however, we don't promise to
    fix it right away unless you send real patches that conform to
    our desire to have transparent cross database support (ie: don't
    send us Oracle specific changes).

#3. XML import/export is completely unstable and not fully
    implemented. Don't count on it working until the next beta (8).

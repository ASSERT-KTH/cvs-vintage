It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/>

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle database creation to a fresh schema fails when ant tries
    to delete non-existent tables prior to creating them.

#2. You may still have some problems working with Oracle. Please let
    us know if you encounter anything, however, we don't promise to
    fix it right away unless you send real patches that conform to
    our desire to have transparent cross database support (ie: don't
    send us Oracle specific changes).

#3. XML import/export is completely unstable and not fully
    implemented. Don't count on it working until the next beta (9).

#4. Localization (display in other languages) is not entirely working 
    yet. There has been a bunch of discussion on the developer
    mailing list about this, but no final answers to fixing the
    problem have been found (as far as I can tell). We will definitely
    get around to fixing this at some point, however if you get to
    it first, that would be great. :-)

#5. There is the possibility that the code surrounding the activity
    and transactions (ie: issue history) is not completely fleshed
    out and debugged.

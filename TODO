			    Struts TODO List
			    ================


Application frameworks, like the applications we build with them, never seem
to be completed.  The following items have been identified as interesting
projects for the continued development of Struts -- volunteers who wish to help
are welcome, as are additional ideas.


Strategic Directions:
--------------------

- Consider how to make the Struts tag library (especially the form related
  tags) more amenable to a WML environment, as well as environments not using
  HTTP (and therefore not using HttpServletRequest/HttpServletResponse).

- Think about segregating the various tags into logically divided sublibraries,
  with the "struts.tld" library still containing all-in-one for backwards
  compatibility.  Considerations for separate libraries:
	* "form" - <struts:form> and all its related tags
	* "i18n" - <struts:message> and other tags specifically related to
          internationalization
	* "logic" - Logical flow of control tags: conditionals, loops
	* "beans" - General access to properties of beans, including
          representation of beans and properties as collections
	* "template" - The template library contributed by David Geary


MVC Framework [org.apache.struts.action]:
----------------------------------------

- Add an option on the ActionForward construct that supports some sort of
  switch across SSL-versus-not access to the same application.  For background,
  See STRUTS-DEV (06/26/2000) Chris Audley.

- Provide a "standard" set of actions that can be configured into a Struts
  application to manage the internal configuration (ActionMappings, etc.) and
  possibly to reload configuration information on demand.  Consider:  new
  sub-package org.apache.struts.action.admin?  Motivation:  STRUTS-DEV
  (07/02/2000) Frank Nestel.

- Support a configurable "default" action mapping if none of the other
  mappings are triggered.  See:  STRUTS-DEV (07/02/2000) Frank Nestel.

- Add an additional (optional) validate() method that takes useful contextual
  arguments (request?, servlet?).  DECISIONS:  Break backwards compatibility?
  new interface?  See: STRUTS-USER (08/01/2000) Chris Audley.

- Configurable option to support calculating a user's Locale (if not already
  present in the session) based on incoming HTTP headers.  See:
  STRUTS-USER (07/02/2000) Robert Edgar, STRUTS-DEV (08/22/2000) Pierre Metras.

- Consider migrating management of action form population out of ActionServlet
  and into ActionMapping.  Motivation:  STRUTS-DEV (08/14/2000)
  Vladimir Blagojevic.

- Review how ActionForm beans get initialized.  Maybe provide a hook by which
  they can be initialized with some context?  Motivation:  STRUTS-USER
  (08/18/2000) Pierre Metras.

- Support configurable standard actions for handling file uploads created by
  the <struts:file> tag.  See:  STRUTS-DEV (08/20/2000) Chris Miller and
  follow-ups.  Also, STRUTS-USER (07/17/2000) "Re: File uploads support".

- Support a second perform() method on Action that takes ServletRequest and
  ServletResponse, for use in non-HTTP environments.  STRUTS-DEV
  (08/23/2000) Frank Nguyen, and follow-ups.


XML Digester [org.apache.struts.digester]:
-----------------------------------------

- Document typical design patterns for using this package.


JDBC Data Sources [org.apache.struts.jdbc]:
------------------------------------------

- Add a "data source" compatible connection pool, and associated supporting
  classes.

- Add tags that make it possible to create "beans" and look up "properties"
  from JDBC results sets.  (Not very Model-2-ish, but very handy in many
  simple cases).


Custom Tag Library [org.apache.struts.taglib]:
---------------------------------------------

	Basic "Struts" Tag Library

- Add tags that treat the rows and columns of a JDBC "RowSet" implementation
  as beans and properties (from the perspective of other tags in Struts).

- Add capability to generate client-side JavaScript functions for basic
  format validations, etc.

- Make the "errors" object returned from validators, and used in the
  <struts:errors> tag, more intelligent and extensible. One option:
  See STRUTS-DEV (06/25/2000) David Geary, STRUTS-DEV (07/18/2000)
  Chris Miller, plus follow-ups.

- Decide on whether to include "else"-type tags on the conditionals, and
  what syntax should be supported.  See:  STRUTS-DEV (06/14/2000) Eduardo
  Pelegri-Llopart; STRUTS-DEV (06/26/2000) Frank Nestel.

- Support "image" buttons, and deal with the name.x/name.y submit parameters
  that you end up receiving.  See: STRUTS-USER (07/17/2000) Alec Bau,
  STRUTS-DEV (07/18/2000) Alec Bau.

- Support "custom populators" for converting between internal and string
  formats of properties.  May generalize into using PropertyEditors.
  Proposal:  STRUTS-USER (07/18/2000) Pasi Salminen.

- Make <struts:form> smart enough to consult the action mappings to figure
  out the attribute name (and class) of the form bean associated with this
  form, if "name" is not specified.  STRUTS-USER (07/23/2000) Richard
  Vowles.

- Improve the mechanism by which you define values and corresponding labels
  for <struts:options>.  Motivation:  STRUTS-DEV (07/27/2000) David
  Winterfeldt, STRUTS-DEV (08/02/2000) David Winterfeldt.

- Add conditionals like ifPropertyLessThan (a specified value),
  ifPropertyTrue (for booleans), ....  Motivation:  See also
  ifAttributeEquals: STRUTS-DEV (07/27/2000) David Winterfeldt.

- Enhance the form management tags to optionally generate JavaScript code
  for client side validation of things like required fields.  Background:
  STRUTS-DEV (07/27/2000) David Winterfeldt, plus follow-ups.

- Enhance <struts:enumerate> and <struts:iterate>, or provide new tags,
  to process parallel collections (such as names and values).  At least
  support 2 collections, but in general "n" would be better.  See
  STRUTS-DEV (08/03/2000) Jeff R.

- Modify tags that implement BodyTag to refer to body content ONLY
  in doAfterTag(), not in doEndTag().  STRUTS-DEV (08/06/2000) Chris Audley.

- Fix Checkboxes!!!  See many notes, including:  STRUTS-DEV (08/08/2000)
  Jeff R.  Also see STRUTS-DEV (08/22/2000) Chris Miller.

- Add "type" attribute on <struts:enumerate> and <struts:iterate> (plus
  anywhere else it makes sense) to define the Java class of the object
  that is exposed.  See:  STRUTS-DEV (08/14/2000) Robert Quillen.

- Improve exception handling inside Struts custom tags.  Among other things,
  encapsulate them as a request attribute to make them visible elsewhere.
  See: STRUTS-DEV (08/17,21/2000) Ken Horn and follow-ups.

- Support "disabled" modifier (from HTML 4.0) on relevant tags.
  STRUTS-USER (08/23/2000) "Re: A new attribute for struts' button tags".

	Templating Tag Library

- Add "templates" tag library contributed by David Geary.

	XML Friendly Tag Library

- Add tag(s) like the <xsl:apply> tag in jakarta-taglibs that facilitate
  treating XML data as beans, properties, and collections.


Tool Classes [org.apache.struts.tools]:
--------------------------------------

- Create tool for XML-description -> JavaBean generation, especially for
  form beans.  Possible Basis:  STRUTS-DEV (06/01,16/2000) Mark Wutka.

- Create tool that reads a JSP page with a <struts:form> in it, and
  generate the Java code for a corresponding form bean.
  STRUTS-USER (08/25/2000) Pierre Metras.


Utility Classes [org.apache.struts.util]:
----------------------------------------

- Implement and test the new PropertyUtils class, which supports nested and
  indexed access to properties (both getters and setters) with no data type
  conversions.

- Modify BeanUtils to utilize the new PropertyUtils support methods.

- Modify BeanUtils to support PropertyEditor-based data conversions between
  String and the internal property formats.

- Add a BeanUtils.copyProperties() method that is more sensitive to type
  conversions than the PropertyUtils.copyProperties() method is.

- Validate behavior of loading resource bundles when the default locale
  is other than en_US.  See: STRUTS-DEV (06/21/2000) Craig Randall.

- Support MessageResources capability to reload bundles that have been
  updated.  Maybe have a switch for auto-reload that is useful during
  development?  Motivation:  STRUTS-DEV (07/24/2000) Chris Miller.

- Make MessageResources an interface with a configurable factory method that
  generates instances.  Motivation:  STRUTS-DEV (07/27/2000) Ignacio
  Ortega, STRUTS-DEV (08/11/2000) Ignacio Ortega.


Documentation and Examples:
--------------------------

- Complete the example application used to illustrate Struts principles.

- Write a more comprehensive example of using a Digester to configure a
  set of related JavaBeans based on the contents of an arbitrary XML file.

- Convert documentation to XML-based source with an XSLT stylesheet.

- Create and maintain a summary of experiences installing and using
  Struts on various container platforms.

- Improve the depth and information in the User's Guide.

- Add an example of a multi-page wizard-type form.

- Update web site information at <http://jakarta.apache.org/struts> to
  include all of the relevant documentation.

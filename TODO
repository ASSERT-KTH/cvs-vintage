			    Struts TODO List
			    ================


Application frameworks, like the applications we build with them, never seem
to be completed.  The following items have been identified as interesting
projects for the continued development of Struts -- volunteers who wish to help
are welcome, as are additional ideas.


Documentation
-------------

- Write a reference manual describing the capabilities of all Java classes
  and all of the custom tags.  (For the custom tags, there is information
  in the "lib/struts.tld" file on what each tag does, and what attributes
  are supported.)

- Write a user's guide that walks the developer through the development of
  a web application based on the Struts outline, and describes the runtime
  execution processing performed for each request.

- Write a more comprehensive example of using a Digester to configure a
  set of related JavaBeans based on the contents of an arbitrary XML file.


Custom Tag Library
------------------

- Add an "iterate" tag that works like "enumerate", but uses the collection
  classes APIs (Java2 or later).

- Add tags that support building the options lists for SELECT elements,
  based on a Map or Dictionary bean.

- Enhance the form management tags to optionally generate JavaScript code
  for client side validation of things like required fields.

- Add tags that generate hyperlinks useful in documentation applications
  ("next page", "previous page", "contents", and so on), and use them
  within the Struts Documentation application itself.

- Add tags that treat the rows and columns of a JDBC "RowSet" implementation
  as beans and properties (from the perspective of other tags in Struts).

- Add tags that paginate long reports (such as the response to a search
  request that shows ten entries per page), with automatic support for
  next and previous page links.

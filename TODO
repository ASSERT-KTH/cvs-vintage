This is the living To-Do list for Tomcat

  * Tomcat core

    * Reduce garbage. We need to recycle objects wherever
      possible. Right now Tomcat is pretty lax about this and there's
      lots of low hanging fruit.

    * Better factor out parsing and processing modules to make clearly
      seperated lines between servers and containers.

    * Work with J2EE team and other server vendors to better define the
      interfaces that allow Tomcat to be embedded into their products.

    * Improve error reporting. Avoid raw stack traces where possible. 

    * The JSP engine generates coordinate information into the servlet
      to provide a mapping from the generated code to the source JSP
      file. This is useful for debuggers. This is broken for
      HTML. Need to fix it. 
     
    * Implement command line compilation of JSP to servlets. Make this
      an Ant task. 

    * Plug in support for other Java compilers in the JSP engine. 

    * Implement and ensure 100% compliance with the Servlet and JSP
      specs as they evolve.

    * Configuration system for Tomcat Standalone and Tomcat+Apache.

    * The messages.properties file for the JSP engine is all messed
      up. At some point we need to figure out a uniform nomenclature
      for all the resource (errors, warnings) names and clean things
      up in the code too. (The earlier the better... its already too
      late :) 

  * Integration with Apache

    * Merge mod_jserv into tomcat cvs, work is underway to split it into
      mod_ajp, mod_wrapper, and mod_ballance.

    * Possibly experiment with XDR to replace AJP as a TCP connector
      protocol.

    * Implement mod_unixsock, mod_pipes, and mod_doors watching for
      integration issues with APR.

    * Experiment with mod_corba for direct integration into J2EE
      compliant servers.

    * Smooth build with Apache httpd 1.3.x

    * Work on build issues with Apache httpd 2.x

  * Tests

    * Add stress tests

    * Add some JSP product tests -- there are none right now

    * Add performance tests -- maybe work with JMeter on this

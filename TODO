This is the living To-Do list for Tomcat

  * Reduce garbage. We need to recycle objects wherever
    possible. Right now Tomcat is pretty lax about this and there's
    lots of low hanging fruit.

  * Better factor out parsind and processing modules to make clearly
    seperated lines between servers and containers.

  * Work with J2EE team and other server vendors to better define the
    interfaces that allow Tomcat to be embedded into their products.

  * Merge mod_jserv into tomcat cvs, work is underway to split it into
    mod_ajp, mod_wrapper, and mod_ballance.

  * Possibly experiment with XDR to replace AJP as a TCP connector
    protocol.

  * Implement mod_unixsock, mod_pipes, and mod_doors watching for
    integration issues with APR.

  * Experiment with mod_corba for direct integration into J2EE
    compliant servers.

  * Smooth build with Apache httpd 1.3.x

  * Work on build issues with Apache httpd 2.x

  * Add stress tests to product tests.

  * Add JSP performance tests -- maybe work with JMeter on this?

  * Improve error reporting.

 * Factory for services. Services are defined here to be "an object that can be
 * requested by key from an IServiceProvider". That is, a service is any object that
 * can be used to satisfy a component's dependencies. Any sort of java object 
 * may be used as a service key as long as the service factory and the code using it agree on the 
 * meaning of each key. The framework normally uses Class objects as keys, and always 
 * returns services that implement that Class. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * A service factory is different from a service provider: A service factory creates new
 * services whereas a service provider returns existing services.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A service factory will often contain many component factories. The service factory 
 * will typically use the key to select a specific component factory and delegate to 
 * the component factory to create the actual service. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>EXPERIMENTAL: The components framework is currently under active development. All
 * aspects of this class including its existence, name, and public interface are likely
 * to change during the development of Eclipse 3.1</p>
 * 
 * @since 3.1

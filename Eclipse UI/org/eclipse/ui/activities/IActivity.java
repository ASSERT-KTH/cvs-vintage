 * An instance of <code>IActivity</code> is a handle representing an activity
 * as defined by the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.activities</code>.
 * The identifier of the handle is identifier of the activity being
 * represented.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>IActivity</code> can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>IActivityManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not an
 * activity with that identifier defined in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation, which causes dynamic changes to the
 * plugin registry, and therefore, potentially, dynamic changes to the set of
 * activity definitions.

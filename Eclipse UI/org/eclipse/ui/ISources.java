/**
 * <p>
 * A source is type of event change that can occur within the workbench. For
 * example, the active workbench window can change, so it is considered a
 * source. Workbench services can track changes to these sources, and thereby
 * try to resolve conflicts between a variety of possible options. This is most
 * commonly used for things like handlers and contexts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the source that are known to the workbench at
 * compile-time. These sources can be combined in a bit-wise fashion. So, for
 * example, a <code>ACTIVE_PART | ACTIVE_CONTEXT</code> source includes change
 * to both the active context and the active part.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The values assigned to each source indicates its relative priority. The
 * higher the value, the more priority the source is given in resolving
 * conflicts. Another way to look at this is that the higher the value, the more
 * "local" the source is to what the user is currently doing. This is similar
 * to, but distinct from the concept of components. The nesting support provided
 * by components represent only one source (<code>ACTIVE_SITE</code>) that
 * the workbench understands.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that for backward compatibility, we must reserve the lowest three bits
 * for <code>Priority</code> instances using the old
 * <code>HandlerSubmission</code> mechanism. This mechanism was used in
 * Eclipse 3.0.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are unused bits. This is intentional, and is intended to allow clients
 * space to define their own priorities. The workbench will not add further
 * priorities in the future without declaring it as a breaking change. If you
 * want to define your own sources, then you must create a
 * <code>ISourceProvider</code> and register it with a workbench service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented or extended by clients.
 * </p>

/**
 * Interface for actions contributed via an extension point.
 * <p>
 * This interface should be implemented by clients who need to contribute actions
 * via an extension point. The workbench will generate a <b>proxy action</b> 
 * object on behalf of the plug-in to avoid having to activate the plug-in until 
 * the user needs it. If the action is performed the workbench will load the class 
 * that implements this interface and create what is called an <b>action 
 * delegate</b> object. Then the request, and all subsequent ones, are
 * forwarded through the proxy action to the action delegate, which does the
 * real work. 
 * </p><p>
 * The proxy action is the one that appears in the UI, so the action delegate 
 * will need to talk to the proxy action in order to keep up an appropriate 
 * appearance. Once the action delegate has been created, it will be
 * notified of all selection changes, allowing it to enable or disable the 
 * proxy action appropriately.
 * </p><p>
 * An action delegate cannot be consulted about selection changes before the
 * action is performed because it does not exist.  For this reason, control of
 * the action's enable state should also be exercised through simple XML rules
 * contained in the extension.  These rules allow enable state control before
 * the action delegate's plug-in is loaded.
 * </p><p>
 * Clients can choose to subclass the provided abstract implementation
 * <code>org. eclipse. ui. actions. ActionDelegate</code> or implement the
 * interface directly.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see org.eclipse.ui.actions.ActionDelegate
 * @see org.eclipse.ui.IActionDelegate2

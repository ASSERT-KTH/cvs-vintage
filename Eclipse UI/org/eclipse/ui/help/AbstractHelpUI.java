 * Abstract base class for the help system UI.
 * <p>
 * The Eclipse platform provides an extension point 
 * (<code>"org.eclipse.ui.helpSupport"</code>) for plugging in a help system UI.
 * The help system UI is an optional component; applications may provide a UI
 * for presenting help to the user by implementing a subclass and including the
 * name of their class in the <code>&lt;config&gt;</code> element in an
 * extension to the <code>"org.eclipse.ui.helpSupport"</code> extension point.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the standard implementation of the help system UI is provided by
 * the <code>"org.eclipse.help.ui"</code> plug-in. Since the platform can only
 * make use of a single help system UI implementation, make sure that the
 * platform is not configured with more than one plug-in trying to extend
 * this extension point.

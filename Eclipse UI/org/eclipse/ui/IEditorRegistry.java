/**
 * Registry of editors known to the workbench.
 * <p>
 * An editor can be created in one of two ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An editor can be defined by an extension to the workbench.</li>
 *   <li>The user manually associates an editor with a given resource extension
 *      type. This will override any default workbench or platform association.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The registry does not keep track of editors that are "implicitly" determined.
 * For example a bitmap (<code>.bmp</code>) file will typically not have a 
 * registered editor. Instead, when no registered editor is found, the 
 * underlying OS is consulted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

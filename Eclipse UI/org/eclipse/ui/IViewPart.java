/**
 * A view is a visual component within a workbench page.  It is typically used to
 * navigate a hierarchy of information (like the workspace), open an editor,  
 * or display properties for the active editor.  Modifications made in a view are 
 * saved immediately (in contrast to an editor part, which conforms to a more 
 * elaborate open-save-close lifecycle).
 * <p>
 * Only one instance of a particular view type may exist within a workbench page.  
 * This policy is designed to simplify part management for a user.  
 * </p><p>
 * This interface may be implemented directly.  For convenience, a base
 * implementation is defined in <code>ViewPart</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A view is added to the workbench in two steps:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>A view extension is contributed to the workbench registry. This
 *    extension defines the extension id and extension class.</li>
 *  <li>The view is included in the default layout for a perspective.
 *    Alternatively, the user may open the view from the Perspective menu.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Views implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface; extensions
 * are managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>

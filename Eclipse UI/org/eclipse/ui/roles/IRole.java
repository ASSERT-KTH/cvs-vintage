/**
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>IRole</code> is a handle representing an role as
 * defined by the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.roles</code>. The
 * identifier of the handle is identifier of the role being represented.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>IRole</code> can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>IRoleManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not a role with
 * that identifier is defined in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation, which causes dynamic changes to the
 * plugin registry, and therefore, potentially, dynamic changes to the set of
 * role definitions.

 * StackPresentations do not store any persistent state and cannot
 * directly make changes to the workbench. They are given an IStackPresentationSite 
 * reference on creation, which allows them to send events and requests to the workbench.
 * However, the workbench is free to ignore these requests. The workbench will call one
 * of the public methods on StackPresentation when (and if) the presentation is expected to 
 * change state. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if the user clicks a button that is intended to close a part, the
 * StackPresentation will send a close request to its site, but should not assume
 * that the part has been closed until the workbench responds with a call 
 * <code>StackPresentation.remove</code>.

     * Creates a part presentation.
     * <p>
     * The presentation creates its controls under the given parent composite.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The role argument indicates how this presentation is being used: whether
     * it presenting editors, regular docked views, fast views, or detached
     * views.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The flags SWT.SINGLE and SWT.MULTI indicate whether this presentation
     * will contain a single part or multiple parts (either SWT.SINGLE or
     * SWT.MULTIPLE is specified, not both). If SWT.SINGLE is specified, then
     * <code>addPart</code> will be called exactly once.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In Eclipse 3.0, SWT.SINGLE is used for presenting fast views and
     * detached views (which are not presented together with other views),
     * while SWT.MULTI is used for presenting editors and docked views. These
     * assumptions may change in future versions of Eclipse, so implementors
     * should base their choice on single vs. multi presentation on these flags
     * rather than on the role argument.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The remaining flags (SWT.MIN, SWT.MAX, SWT.MOVE) indicate whether the
     * corresponding operation is supported by the presentation. These
     * operations apply to the presentation as a whole, including all parts it
     * contains.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The perspective id and folder id can be used to tailor the choice of
     * presentation to particular perspectives or folders within a perspective.
     * To preserve Eclipse's independence of presentation and function, neither
     * the presentation factory nor the part presentation implementation should
     * refer directly to particular perspectives or folders (nor should
     * perspectives refer to particular presentations). Any mapping between
     * perspectives, folders and presentations should be done extrinsically,
     * for example using a separate extension point to associate a perspective
     * or folder with a presentation. Maintaining this separation of concerns
     * allows functional components (views, editors, perspectives) and
     * presentations to be mixed and matched independently across different
     * products.

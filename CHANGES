      appended to the "Search" vFolder as child-folder. 
      History functionality saves the last 10 searches. If you

      else

Version 0.9.8

    * Fixed the ELHO/HELO smtp commands to use "localhost.localdomain" 
      instead of the real hostname. This should fix problems with 
      TCP-tunneling, NAT (IP Masquerading in Linux), and hosts without 
      fully qualified domainname (Eduardo Pérez)
    * Fixed imap folder bug, which prevented INBOX from appearing (Frederik)
    * Changed imap folder hierarchy parser. The delimiter character isn't 
      hardcoded anymore. This fixes the folder hierarchy view for cyrus 
      imapd. (Frederik)
    * Imap serverside copying/moving/deleting operates on all messages at 
      once, instead of sending a command for every message. (Frederik)
    * Fixed imap headerlist synchronization bug (Frederik)
    * Imap headercache-file is regenerated automatically on startup, 
      if corrupted. (Frederik)
    * Imap adding/removing folders now correctly un-/subscribes folder 
      automatically. This fixes a problem with uw-imapd server, 
      which showed folders as subscribed even if they didn't 
      exist anymore. (Frederik)
    * Fixed a outbox-folder bug, which prevented sending mails, if you 
      didn't selected it at some time before. (Frederik)
    * Added AUTH PLAIN SMTP authentication method.
    * Changed the smtp-authenticate default behaviour. Columba tries to 
      use ESMTP now, if the user wants to, even if the CAPABILITY response 
      didn't comply to RFC.
    * Applying filters is know blazingly fast (Timo)
    * Fixed a threading bug, which made the gui-worker freeze. A worker 
      can now be cancelled, which automatically cancels the corresponding 
      worker on the other end of the channel. (Timo)



Version 0.9.7
   
   - ported to JDK1.4
   - no more need for jaxp.jar/parser.jar packages (just do a 
     "java org.columba.main.Main",no classpath modification needed) 
   - you can use now one config-folder for different operation systems
   - default behavior for "reply"-action is know to show the message inline
   - added "reply as attachment"
   - added "forward inline"
   - added "open message in composer" action
   - in the composer you can save a message as draft or template
   - you can open now multiple instances of the composer frame
   - added "send later" action

    * imap subscribe/unsubscribe-dialog works now correctly
    * implemented imap server-side searching (you can now apply filters on 
      imap folders and especially use VFolders)
    * added POP-before-SMTP (SMTP-after-POP) authentification to mail sending
    * fixed some pop3 synchronization bugs





Version 0.9.5

This release finally fixed those POP3 authentification problems people had. 
We have to thank James Beam for his extraordinary help on this subject. 
But we have also added some new features:

    * POP3 mailchecking plays a soundfile when new messages arrive
    * new options for POP3 mailchecking to enable/disable automatic message 
      downloading
    * serverside IMAP copying/moving/deleting of messages
    * when downloading bodytext or mimepart from IMAP server you can now 
      see the download progress
    * bodytext doesn't get fetched twice times from IMAP server anymore



Version 0.9.4

This is a minor bugfix release. We had complains from people who couldn't 
authenticate via POP3. So I hope this version fixes the problem.
Also added a small feature: if you reply or forward a message it gets 
marked as replied.




Version 0.9.3

This is a *must have* release. We fixed some very serious bugs and added some 
mailing-list specific features. So if you are not already subscribed to our

      folders (Timo)
    * reply to mailinglist works now as expected (Frederik)
    * added Message-ID, In-Reply-To and References headers - we need these for 
      message threading (Frederik)
    * fixed some pop3-remote-control bugs (Frederik)

            raw text Viewer (fast), or you choose the Advanced Viewer which

            a html viewer for html messages.
    * POP3:
          * message download size limit implemented

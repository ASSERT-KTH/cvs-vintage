      fully qualified domainname (Eduardo P�rez)
    * Fixed imap folder bug, which prevented INBOX from appearing (Frederik)

      hardcoded anymore. This fixes the folder hierarchy view for cyrus 
      imapd. (Frederik)

      once, instead of sending a command for every message. (Frederik)

      if corrupted. (Frederik)

      which showed folders as subscribed even if they didn't 
      exist anymore. (Frederik)

      didn't selected it at some time before. (Frederik)

      didn't comply to RFC.
    * Applying filters is know blazingly fast (Timo)
    * Fixed a threading bug, which made the gui-worker freeze. A worker 
      can now be cancelled, which automatically cancels the corresponding 
      worker on the other end of the channel. (Timo)



Version 0.9.7
   
   - ported to JDK1.4
   - no more need for jaxp.jar/parser.jar packages (just do a 
     "java org.columba.main.Main",no classpath modification needed)

   - default behavior for "reply"-action is know to show the message inline
   - added "reply as attachment"

      imap folders and especially use VFolders)
    * added POP-before-SMTP (SMTP-after-POP) authentification to mail sending
    * fixed some pop3 synchronization bugs





Version 0.9.5

This release finally fixed those POP3 authentification problems people had. 
We have to thank James Beam for his extraordinary help on this subject. 
But we have also added some new features:

    * POP3 mailchecking plays a soundfile when new messages arrive
    * new options for POP3 mailchecking to enable/disable automatic message 
      downloading
    * serverside IMAP copying/moving/deleting of messages
    * when downloading bodytext or mimepart from IMAP server you can now 
      see the download progress
    * bodytext doesn't get fetched twice times from IMAP server anymore



Version 0.9.4

This is a minor bugfix release. We had complains from people who couldn't 
authenticate via POP3. So I hope this version fixes the problem.
Also added a small feature: if you reply or forward a message it gets 
marked as replied.

      folders (Timo)

      message threading (Frederik)

            raw text Viewer (fast), or you choose the Advanced Viewer which

            a html viewer for html messages.
    * POP3:
          * message download size limit implemented

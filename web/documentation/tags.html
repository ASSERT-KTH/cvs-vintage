<h1><i>errors</i> - Conditionally Display Error Messages</h1>

<p>Displays a set of error messages prepared by a business logic component
and stored as a <code>String[]</code> request scope bean.  If such a bean
is not found, nothing will be rendered.</p>

<p>In order to use this tag successfully, you must have defined an application
scope <code>MessageResources</code> bean under the default attribute name,
with at least the following message keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>errors.header</b> - Text that will be rendered before the error
    messages list.  Typically, this message text ends with
    <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> to start the error messages list.</li>
<li><b>errors.detail</b> - Text that will be rendered for each error message,
    with <code>{0}</code> replacement text for the message actually generated
    by the business logic component.  A typical value for this message text is
    <code>"&lt;li&gt;{0}&lt;/li&gt;"</code>.</li>
<li><b>errors.footer</b> - Text that will be rendered after the error messages
    list.  Typically, this message text begins with
    <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> to end the error messages list.</li>

This document describes the changes that have been made since the
last release of Tomcat 3.3.

=========
Bug Fixes
=========

Feature Additions:

Bug No.  Description

         Restored prefix attribute to InvokerInterceptor.  It was available in
         Tomcat 3.2.x.

         Added SingleThreadModel pooling to ServletHandler.  The default is to
         use pooling.

         Added optional checking (configured on SessionId module) to ensure
         that the SSL session IDs match for each request within a Tomcat
         session.  This check is disabled by default.

         Added org.apache.tomcat.util.net.URL class from Tomcat 4.0 so
         response.encodeURL() can work under SSL without JSSE.  This can occur
         if you have Apache forwarding SSL requests to a Tomcat that doesn't
         have JSSE installed.

	 Fixed logic for response.encodeURL() so that it will work correctly 
	 if the input URL includes an anchor tag.

	 Improved the handling of invalid web.xml files.  Now you get the same
	 error messages everytime you parse the file.

	 Moved the setting of the default "*.jsp" mapping so that it is now 
	 possible to entirely disable support for jsp files.

         Context properties and ContextManager properties can now be set with
         <Property ... /> elements, i.e: 
             <Property name="propname" value="thevalue" />
         For backwards compatibility, the ContextManager "lower-case-p"
         <property ... /> version supported by Tomcat 3.3. is still supported.

         Added variable substitution handling to ContextXmlReader, allowing
         variable substitution to be used in <Context ...></Context>
         declarations.


Server:

Bug No.  Description

4418     Ported Tomcat 3.2.x fix for race condition in ServerSocketFactory.

4436     Reduce log output from DecodeInterceptor if debug level is zero.  This
         avoids having a log entry for each request.

4564     Fix bug in Http10Interceptor where getRemoteAddr() returns 127.0.0.1
         instead of correct address.

4599     ThreadPool was updated to not reset the maxThreads, maxSpareThreads
         and minSpareThreads values in its start() method.

         Fixed problem in AccessInterceptor where the beginning characters
         of the login or error page match the context path.  Tomcat could
         mistakenly think that the context path had been incorrectly included
         in the login or error page setting.  It can still make this mistake
         if the page is under a sub-directory with the same name as the
         context path.
         
         The missing jdbcRealm.getCredentialsSQLException property string was
         added.

         Fixed bug with useJspServlet option in JspInterceptor.  If set to true
         untrusted web applications couldn't run the JspServlet because
         jasper.jar and tools.jar weren't accessible.

4955	 Fixed bug in the parsing of the query string to 
	 RequestDispatcher.include/forward wasn't handling the case where only
	 the parameter name was specified.

4948	 Fix DependClassLoader to be a Java2 ClassLoader when running under
	 a Java2 JVM.  

5005     If requested JSP file doesn't exist, avoid creating work directories
         and version file.

	 Fixed problem with jsp_precompile parameter to JSP files.

         Eliminated some hard coded '\n' line separators used by Jasper in the
         translated Java file.


Configuration:

Bug No.  Description

4313     Bug in property substitution for server.xml and apps.xml files was
         fixed.

4826     Fixed AutoWebApp so the dir attribute can be an absolute path on
         Windows systems.


Documentation:

Bug No.  Description

         Tomcat-on-NetWare-HowTo.html updated to fix errors related to new
         functionality in Tomcat 3.3.

         tomcat-ug.html updated with additional classloader information and
         details on the variable substitution available in Context
         declarations.
     
         serverxml.html updated to document new checkSSLSessionId attribute on
         SessionId module.  A note was added to Ajp12Connector to document the
         requirement for maxThreads to be 2 or more if it is to be used to
         shutdown Tomcat.  Section on variable substitution was updated.

         tomcat-iis-howto.html updated to make it clearer that the "Filter Dlls"
         key is used only on Win98.

         JDBCRealm-howto.html updated to name the correct class and its jar
         location for digested passwords.

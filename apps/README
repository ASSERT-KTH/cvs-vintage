Various applications that are not required for normal
tomcat functionality, but provide additional support.

The new contributed admin pages, and new apps ( like config or
monitoring ) should be developed here, independent of
the main tomcat release. When the app is stable and 
have the same quality with the rest of tomcat we can 
vote to include it in the stable release, but as 
the development is active the apps can be built and 
released separately.

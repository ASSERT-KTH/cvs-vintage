            Below are some notes for doing development with Scarab.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because Scarab uses a build->compile->run development framework, you should 
remember to always edit only the files in the src directory and not the 
target build directory.

Once you have edited a file in the src directory, you need to make sure to 
execute the build.sh script again. If you edit a .java source file, then you 
should execute [./build.sh compile]. If you edit any other file, then you 
only need to execute [./build.sh prepare].

If, you make a change to a source file and you don't see that change 
reflected in what you are doing, make sure to read the note above. :-)

If you delete a src/java or src/template file you will need to delete the 
corresponding src files as well as any .class files from within the target tree 
and then re-compile. For example:

Delete:
scarab/src/java/org/tigris/scarab/screens/Foo.java
Also Delete:
scarab/target/webapps/scarab/WEB-INF/src/java/org/tigris/scarab/screens/Foo.java
scarab/target/webapps/scarab/WEB-INF/classes/org/tigris/scarab/screens/Foo.class

You can make the above procedure easier by simply removing the entire target 
tree and re-creating it. Next, you are going to ask why the source file is 
stored in the WEB-INF directory. The reason is because Ant allows us to do 
String replacement in the source files. So, at some point in the future, we will 
probably use this functionality to include a version number into one of the 
source files so that it is possible to see what version of Scarab is running. 
There are other reasons for doing this as well, but this is an easy example to 
explain. :-)

At any point, you should be able to build a fresh target tree. This means 
that you should be able to kill Tomcat, remove the target directory and 
re-execute the build.sh script.

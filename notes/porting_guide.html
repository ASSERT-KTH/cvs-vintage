<h4>Interface IWorkingCopy (package org.eclipse.jdt.core; plug-in org.eclipse.jdt.core)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Historically, IWorkingCopy gathered all working copy concerns, and ICompilationUnit implement this interface, 
        though only the factory method makes sense for them; thus their implementation of the working copy features 
        do nothing relevant to clients. IWorkingCopy also implements the spec'ed factory method, but it doesn't work for these.</li>
   <li>Interface IWorkingCopy is removed and all its functionality is moved to ICompilationUnit.</li>
   <li>Clients using IWorkingCopy and ICompilationUnit can adapt to this change by referencing ICompilationUnit instead of 
         IWorkingCopy when a working copy is needed. For example:
         <pre>
         ICompilationUnit compilationUnit = ...;
         IWorkingCopy workingCopy = (IWorkingCopy)compilationUnit.getWorkingCopy();
         workingCopy.reconcile(true/*force problem detection*/, null/*no progress monitor*/);
         </pre>
         should now be:
         <pre>
         ICompilationUnit compilationUnit = ...;
         ICompilationUnit workingCopy = compilationUnit.getWorkingCopy(null/*no progress monitor*/);
         workingCopy.reconcile(true/*force problem detection*/, null/*no progress monitor*/);
         </pre>
         </li>
</ul>

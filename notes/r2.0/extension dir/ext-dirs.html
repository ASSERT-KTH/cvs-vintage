<h2>
Extension Directories</h2>
Last revised 17:10 Thursday October 25, 2001
<p>Work item: Add support to Java model for JDK 1.2-style extension directories
(aka optional packages)
<p>An extension directory is a folder containing any number of JAR files
(including 0). Extension directories were originally added in JDK 1.2,
and are described in <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/extensions/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/extensions/index.html</a>.
<p>The proposal is to allow a library classpath entry to refer to an extension
directory. A library classpath entry (<tt>CPE_LIBRARY</tt>) with a path
whose last segment is "*" indicates an extension directory; for example,
a library entry with the path "D:/jdk1.4/jre/lib/ext/*" means the extension
directory "D:/jdk1.4/jre/lib/ext". Like all library entries, extension
directories can be in folders inside the workspace or in directories in
the local file system outside the workspace. A variable classpath entry
may also resolve to an extension directory following the same rule about
ending in "*". Thus a variable classpath entry like "JRE_LIB/ext/*" would
resolve to an extension directory; and a simple one like "FOO" could resolve
to either a JAR library, a library folder, an extension directory, or a
project.
<p>Each of the JARs in an extension directory on a project's class path
would give rise to a separate <tt>IPackageFragmentRoot</tt> (kind <tt>K_BINARY</tt>);
these package fragment roots are all child elements of the <tt>IJavaProject</tt>.
The Java model would not have a Java element corresponding to the extension
directory itself. A classpath entry that identifies a extension folder
internal to the workspace gives rise to 0, 1, or more binary package fragment
roots for JAR file resources internal to the workspace; similarly, a classpath
entry that identifies a extension folder external to the workspace gives
rise to binary package fragment roots for JAR files outside the workspace.
<p>Every package fragment root that is a child of a project element stems
from some entry on that project's original classpath. Given a package fragment
root, how does one trace it back to the classpath entry that gave rise
to it? In the presence of variable classpath entries and extension directories,
the answer is not obvious. Having a simple answer is important to some
clients. For instance, the Java UI includes the names of classpath variables
in items in its Packages view.
<p><tt>IPackageFragmentRoot</tt>
<br><tt>/**</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* Returns the classpath entry that gives rise to this package
fragment root.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* This package fragment root must exist. The returned classpath
entry is</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* equivalent to one of the classpath entries of this package
fragment</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* root's project.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;*</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* @return the originating classpath entry</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* @exception JavaModelException if this element does not
exist</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;*/</tt>
<br><tt>IClasspathEntry getOriginatingClasspathEntry() throws JavaModelException;</tt>
<p>This method would replace <tt>IJavaProject.getPackageFragmentRoots(IClasspathEntry
entry)</tt>, which has problems and would be removed from the API (via
deprecation).
<h3>
Packages View Clutter</h3>
The packages view would show all the JARs from an extension directory as
children of a project. Packages view clutter exists for anyone with a large
number of JAR libraries on their build classpath. Extension directories
exacerbate the problem by making it easy to include a whole set of JAR
libraries with a single classpath entry (WSAD reputedly has 70+ JARs in
its extension directory).
<p>The packages view supports filtering out JAR libraries, meaning they
could be hidden. However, the filter is off by default and not all users
are aware that the filter even exists.
<p>Note that extension folders typically contain a bunch of unrelated JARs,
making it likely that a user will be interested in a particular subset
and uninterested in the rest. The IBM 1.3.0 JRE jre\lib\ext contains indicim.jar
and JawBridge.jar. The Sun JDK 1.4.0-beta jre\lib\ext contains dnsns.jar,
ldapsec.jar, and sunjre_provider.jar. All these JARs are likely pure noise
and do not contain API that a client would write to.&nbsp; In a J2EE JRE,
there would be a diverse collection of JARs in the jre\lib\ext extension
directory (e.g., Java Telephony, JavaMail, Java 2D, Java 3D, Java Media
Frameworks), only a handful of which would be used within any given project.
<p>One idea is to allow a new JavaElement "ExtensionFolder". This would
allow to group the extension JARs and would avoid some clutter. Although
an extension folder element could avoid clutter, it may not provide enough
of an improvement over the existing filtering mechanism to warrant complicating
the Java model API.
<p>[This problem is still open. I recommend living with the currently supported
filtering for now. We could come back later and look at ways to reduce
clutter as a separate work item.]
<h3>
Default Build Classpath</h3>
The standard JRE implicitly has the jre/lib/ext extension directory on
its runtime classpath. By default, the build classpath for a typical project
should include entries for both the standard class library (jre/lib/rt.jar)
and the standard extension directory (jre/lib/ext/*).
<p>These defaults should be a function of the VM launcher for the project.
It should always be possible for the user to override the defaults and
set up their build classpath as they see fit.
<h3>
Build Classpath Ordering</h3>
The UI currently allows users to freely reorder package fragment roots
for the project. This does not really make sense for package fragments
roots that arise from extension directories.
<p>Indeed, the addition of extension directories means that there is no
longer a 1-1 correspondence between package fragment roots and classpath
entries. The UI should allow the user to determine the order of classpath
entries. Here are the guidelines and restrictions on the build classpath
for a project (N.B., these apply to the raw classpath, not necessarily
to a partially or fully "resolved" classpath):
<ul>
<li>
There may be 0, 1, or more source folders on the classpath. The relative
ordering of multiple source folders is significant to the user. Source
code in an earlier source folder hides a source file of the same name in
a later folder. This flexibility is rarely used: multiple source folders
is rare enough, and duplicated source files, even rarer.</li>

<li>
Source folders must precede all other types of classpath entries. Nothing
should hide source (except another source). This property is implicitly
relied on whenever a source code patch is being applied to a binary library.</li>

<li>
The relative ordering of non-source classpath entries (library folders,
library JARs, extension folders, required projects, and ones involving
variables) is significant to the user. The main reason it is significant
is to deal with conflicting library versions, where the user needs to control
which version wins. The ones earlier in the list should take precedence
over ones later in the list.</li>

<li>
For a standard Java runtime, all libraries on the boot classpath (usually
just the standard JRE class library) are consulted, in the order specified,
and before other libraries). Placing the standard JRE class library as
the first non-source entry on the build classpath mirrors the most common
configuration.</li>

<li>
For a standard Java runtime, all extension directories (usually just the
standard JRE extension directory) are consulted, in the order specified,
after libraries on the boot classpath but before other libraries. Within
an extension directory, the various library JARs are consulted in unspecified
order. Placing the standard JRE extension directory as the second non-source
entry on the build classpath mirrors the most common configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Build Classpath Duplicates</h3>
How are duplicates libraries on the build classpath handled? For instance,
if there are two classpath entries on a project's build classpath for exactly
the same JAR, should there be one or two package fragment roots? What if
a JAR classpath entry explicitly mentions a JAR that is included in an
extension folder also on the build classpath?
<p>At the Java model API, package fragment roots are handle objects with
well-known identity criteria. It turns out that this dictates the answer
to how dupicates are handled.
<p>For library package fragment roots based on a resource in the workspace,
the identity criteria includes the resource handle (handle constructor
isJavaProject.getPackageFragmentRoot(IResource)) For library package fragment
roots based on files outside the workspace, the identity criteria includes
the path (handle constructor isJavaProject.getPackageFragmentRoot(String)).
<p>This means the answer is forced: any duplication in the build classpath
necessarily washes out in the mapping to package fragment roots. Two classpath
entries for exactly the same JAR must map to a single package fragment
root. JARs from an extension directory gives rise to the same package fragment
roots one would get if each JAR was mentioned explicitly.
<p>In the case of duplicates, we do have a choice for which classpath entry
is considered the originating one. <tt>IPackageFragmentRoot.getOriginatingClasspathEntry()</tt>,
described above, will be used to locate an entry in the build classpath
carring important source attachment information. A specific classpath entry
should always be preferred to a generic classpath entry (extension folders
entries carry no source attahment info), and an earlier entry should be
preferred over a later one.
<p>For example, given the following (unusual) build classpath:
<br>&lt;classpath>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;classpathentry kind="lib" path="/jre/lib/ext/*">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;classpathentry kind="lib"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path="/jre/lib/ext/servlet.jar"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sourcepath="/src/servletsrc.zip">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;classpathentry kind="lib"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path="/jre/lib/ext/servlet.jar"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sourcepath="/backup/servletsrc.zip">
<br>&lt;/classpath>
<br>the package fragment root for "/jre/lib/ext/servlet.jar" is considered
to originate from the second classpath entry: the second is more specific
that the first, and is equally specific to, but ordered earlier than, the
third.
<h3>
Extension Directories and the Runtime Classpath</h3>
By default, jre/lib/ext is the extension directory at runtime. Overriding
this default entails specifying a command line argument to set the value
of the <tt>java.ext.dirs</tt> system property. This system property specifies
one or more directories to search for installed extensions, each separated
by <tt>File.pathSeparatorChar</tt>.
<p>We need to determine whether the JAR needs to be added to the runtime
class path or not. Since the launcher is JVM-install-type-specific, it
feels like the right place to hardcode the knowledge of how to map a build
classpath to a runtime classpath. The JAR for the standard class library
does not need to be included in the runtime classpath because it is implicitly
on the boot classpath. Similarly, any JAR that is included in an extension
directory does not need to be mentioned explicitly.
<h3>
Attaching Source to Library JARs in an Extension Folder</h3>
JARs from extension directories are not really any different from other
class libraries. It would make debugging difficult if there were no way
to attached source code to a JAR in a extension directory.
<p>How does one attach source to JARs in an extension directory? As you
recall from R0.9, we consciously opted to put the source attachment information
in a place where it would be sharable, rather than leave this information
local to the workspace. The API for attaching source is on the classpath
entry; this allows this information to be shared between developers. Clearly,
this would not work for extension directories, where the names of the JARs
in the directory might not even be known in advance. There is no general
naming scheme for locating the source code for a given JAR (we do not proposing
to invent one).
<p>As discussed in the section on package view clutter, it will be common
for an extension directory to contain a diverse set of JARs, only a handful
of which would be used within any given project. The proposal is to provide
no direct support for attaching source via an extension folder classpath
entry. If the user needs to see source code for a JAR in an extension folder,
they would need to create an additional explicit classpath entry for that
JAR. As discussed above, this would not result in a new package fragment
root; however, it would effectively change the originating classpath entry
to the explicit one where the source attachment information would be found.
This would allow the user to attach source code to JARs on an as-needed
basis. The bet is that this will suffice (and finesses the issue of where
one might find the source for a JAR in an extension folder).

<h2>
Notes on Workspace Structure</h2>
Last revised&nbsp; 17:00 Wednesday September 26, 2001
<p>In large Java development efforts, it is not uncommon for several inter-related
projects to be under development at the same time. For the purposes of
this discussion, assume teams, projects, and components align. All teams
are working in the same repository, sharing a set of projects via a single
stream; each project contains the source code for a single component.
<p>Our example scenario has 4 projects: P1, P2, P3, and P4, with components
C1 through C4, respectively. C1 is the only component that does not depend
on any others; C2 depends on C1; C3 depends on C1 and C2; C4 depends on
C2 (N.B., but not on C1 or C3).
<p>We assume that there is a single CVS repository that contains all 4
projects in source code form. In addition, we assume that centralized builds
are done periodically and posted to a web server where they can be downloaded
as a unit. These downloads take the form of a zipped directory which includes
a binary jar for each component, along with corresponding source jars to
aid debugging.
<p>We assume that each developer can download builds from the web server
and install them on their local machine. To do their work, they set up
Eclipse workspaces on their local machine and load one or more projects
from the CVS repository. They also upgrade their workspace from time to
time as new builds become available.
<p>These assumptions are a plausible abstraction of what goes on in open
source projects. (It is an open question as to how closely the Eclipse
project with follow this work model.)
<h3>
Developing, Using, and Patching Components</h3>
The following things are the norm for someone actively <b>developing</b>
a component:
<ul>
<li>
source code is available for entire component</li>

<li>
source code is being browsed and changed</li>

<li>
source code is being compiled regularly</li>

<li>
source code changes are shared occasionally with other team members</li>
</ul>
At the other end of the spectrum are components that are passively <b>used</b>:
<ul>
<li>
component is available as pre-compiled binary library</li>

<li>
source code is available for browsing but not for editing</li>

<li>
since used component is static, no changes to share with other team members</li>
</ul>
Components that are being <b>patched</b> are one step from being a used
component in the direction of being a component being developed:
<ul>
<li>
component is available as pre-compiled binary library</li>

<li>
source code is selectively available for editing (patching)</li>

<li>
patched source code is compiled and used instead of pre-compiled binary</li>

<li>
patched source code is for local consumption (not shared with other team
members)</li>
</ul>
The general problem can be stated as follows: each developer needs their
own workspace so that they can <i>develop</i> their assigned component.
To to do, they will need to <i>use</i> the components that their component
depends on, and perhaps use some of the other components that depend on
theirs. In order to do their work, a developer may need to <i>patch</i>
a component that they would ordinarily just <i>use</i>; in some cases,
they might even need to actively develop a component that they would ordinarily
just <i>use</i>. How can the developers structure their workspaces so that
they retain sufficient flexibly to switch between using and patching (or
developing) these other components?
<p>The various scenarios presented below are all plausible workspace setups,
each with certain advantages and disadvantages:

loading an additional project).</li>

<li>
Con: unable to browse code for prerequiste components in proper content

<li>
Pro: no restriction on number of jars per project.</li>

<li>
Note: the exported libraries are external to the project.</li>

<li>
Note: uses library projects (proposed for R2.0).</li>
</ul>
The base workspace for developers on all teams looks like:
<p>project P1 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c1.jar+BUILD/c1src.zip
<br>&amp;
<br>project P2 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c2.jar+BUILD/c2src.zip;
project P1
<br>&amp;
<br>project P3 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c3.jar+BUILD/c3src.zip;
project P1; project P2
<br>&amp;
<br>project P4 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c4.jar+BUILD/c3src.zip;
project P2
<p>None of these projects are shared; however, they have the same names
as the source projects in repository. This means that any of the library
projects can be replaced by loading the corresponding source project from
the repository. (None of the other projects in the workspace need to change.)
<p>project P1 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/C1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P1/bin
<br>|
<br>project P2 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P2/C2; project P1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P2/bin
<br>|
<br>project P3 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P3/C3; project P1; project
P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P3/bin
<br>|
<br>project P4 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P4/C4; project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P4/bin
<p>Regarding automation, the centralized build could create a simple XML
document describing the collection of proxy library projects for the workspace.
Given this document, a special purpose plug-in could be written that would
create (or modify existing) unshared proxy library projects in the workspace.

<h3>
<a NAME="Shared proxy library projects"></a>Shared proxy library projects</h3>
In the previous approach to using proxy library projects, these projects
were not under VCM. In this variant of it, the proxy library projects are
obtained from a repository as well. We will assume that the proxy library
projects are stored in a different repository from the source projects.
By assuming they're in a separate binary repository, it is easy to use
the same project names for both source and binary forms (doing so in the
same repository would required introducing non-standard binary-only and
source-only branches in the project version histories).
<ul>
<li>
Team member's workspace contains a project for each component.</li>

<li>
Main project is in source and is shared via the repository.</li>

<li>
All other projects in workspace are proxy library projects; same name as
source project, but in a different repository.</li>

<li>
Each proxy library project contains and exports one or more binary jar
libraries (plus attached source zips) equivalent to the source.</li>

<li>
Build classpath references individual dependent projects by name.</li>

<li>
Pro: able to browse code for all components.</li>

<li>
Pro: easy to switch to another binary build.</li>

<li>
Pro: switch to patching involves adding source and output folders to shared
proxy library project, populating with selected source files, and building;
no other classpaths need to be changed.</li>

<li>
Pro: switch to development involves loading shared source project into
workspace over top of shared proxy library project with the same name;
no classpaths need to be changed.</li>

<li>
Pro: easy to upgrade to another binary build (by catching up with binary
stream in repository).</li>

<li>
Pro: no restriction on number of jars per project.</li>

<li>
Pro: Proxy library projects are also under VCM.</li>

<li>
Con: initial workspace setup involving multiple shared projects (automation
possible).</li>

<li>
Con: Additional effort of building and maintained proxy library projects
in a separate repository (automation possible, perhaps as part of centralized
build process).</li>

<li>
Con: project holding component under development is lost in sea of proxy
library projects.</li>

<li>
Note: the exported libraries are internal to the project.</li>

<li>
Note: uses library projects (proposed for R2.0).</li>
</ul>
The base workspace for developers on all teams looks like:
<p>project P1 (shared via binary repository)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export /P1/c1.jar+BUILD/c1src.zip
<br>&amp;
<br>project P2 (shared via binary repository)

<br>project P4 (shared via binary repository)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export /P4/c4.jar+BUILD/c4src.zip;

<p>The proxy library projects have the same names as the source projects,
but are stored in a separate repository.
<p>project P1 (shared via source repository)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/C1

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P4/C4; project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P4/bin
<h3>
<a NAME="Stub projects"></a>Stub projects</h3>
This is a variation on unshared proxy library projects that makes different
tradeoffs. We call these <i>stub projects</i>. In particular, the ability
to browse a prereqisite component is traded for the ability to have only
a minimal set of extra library projects in the workspace. The only difference
is that stub projects do not require other projects (whereas proxy library
projects did require other projects). This allow a workspace to get by
with a less than complete set of stub projects. Creating a stub project
never forces you to create other stub projects.
<ul>
<li>
Main project is in source and is shared via the repository.</li>

<li>
That project's required projects are represented in workspace by stub projects
(same name as source project; not shared via repository).</li>

<li>
Stub projects are library projects (no source code).</li>

<li>
A stub project only represents a project's outward appearance to other
projects.</li>

<li>
Stub projects never require any other projects.</li>

<li>
Each team members downloads latest binary build to c:\temp\build\ or some
such and sets classpath variable BUILD = c:\temp\build\</li>

<li>
Build classpath exports libraries relative to BUILD classpath variable.</li>

<li>
Use of classpath variable allows each developer to choose where to install
the build.</li>

<li>
Build classpath references individual dependent projects by name.</li>

<li>
Pro: stub projects are needed only for immediate prerequisites of main
project.</li>

<li>
Con: unable to view code for a component that is not a prerequisite (requires
loading an additional project).</li>

<li>
Con: unable to browse code for prerequiste components in proper content
(code completion) because stub does not provide sufficient context.</li>

<li>
Con: patching only via switching to active development.</li>

<li>
Pro: switch to development involves loading an additional shared project
into workspace, possibly over top of stub project; no classpaths need to
be changed.</li>

<li>
Pro: easy to upgrade to another binary build (unzip build in place, and
close and reopen project in workspace to force a refresh).</li>

<li>
Con: initial workspace setup involving multiple shared projects and stub
projects; ongoing need for additional stub projects when new source projects
are loaded (automation required).</li>

<li>
Pro: no restriction on number of jars per project.</li>

<li>
Fatal flaw (!): limited able to compile against a stub project due to lack
of sufficient context Note: the exported libraries are external to the
project.</li>

<li>
Note: uses library projects (proposed for R2.0).</li>
</ul>
The source projects:
<p>project P1 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/C1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P1/bin
<br>|
<br>project P2 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P2/C2; project P1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P2/bin
<br>|
<br>project P3 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P3/C3; project P1; project
P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P3/bin
<br>|
<br>project P4 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P4/C4; project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P4/bin
<p>The corresponding stub projects (note the absence of required projects):
<p>project P1 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c1.jar+BUILD/c1src.zip
<p>project P2 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c2.jar+BUILD/c2src.zip
<p>project P3 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c3.jar+BUILD/c3src.zip
<p>project P4 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c4.jar+BUILD/c3src.zip
<p>For example, a developer working on P3 would need stub projects for
P1 and P2.
<p>project P3 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P3/C3; project P1; project
P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P3/bin
<br>&amp;
<br>project P2 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c2.jar+BUILD/c2src.zip
<br>&amp;
<br>project P1 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c1.jar+BUILD/c1src.zip
<p>If they then decided to develop P1 as well, they would replace P1 by
the souce project. Their workspace would now look like:
<p>project P3 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P3/C3; project P1; project
P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P3/bin
<br>&amp;
<br>project P2 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c2.jar+BUILD/c2src.zip
<br>&amp;
<br>project P1 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/C1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P1/bin
<p>The fatal flaw is clear in the case of a workspace containing P4 and
a stub for P2.
<p>project P4 (shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P4/C4; project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output folder /P4/bin
<br>&amp;
<br>project P2 (not shared)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = export BUILD/c2.jar+BUILD/c2src.zip
<p>If, for example, a class in C4 subclasses a class in C2 which subclasses
a class in C1, then the compiler will need to get its hands on the class
in C1. Unfortunately, neither the source code nor binary for C1 is anywhere
to be found.
<h3>
<a NAME="Other Scenarios"></a>Assorted Other Scenarios</h3>
A couple of other scenarios can be constructed using a combination of the
techniques employed above:
<ul>
<li>
Unshared proxy library projects with different project names.</li>

<br>Use a classpath variable per component; bind it initially to the name
of the proxy library project; rebind to name of the source project.
<ul>
<li>
Pro: Allows side-by-side proxy library project and source project.</li>

<li>
Con: Uses both classpath variables and proxy library projects.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Shared proxy library projects with different project names.</li>

<br>Same as preceding except the proxy library projects can be shared.
Use a classpath variable per component; bind it initially to the name of
the proxy library project; rebind to name of the source project. Since
the proxy library project and source projects have different names, there
are no VCM anomalies.
<ul>
<li>
Pro: Allows side-by-side proxy library project and source project.</li>

<li>
Pro: Proxy library projects are also under VCM.</li>

<li>
Con: Uses both classpath variables and proxy library projects.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Shared proxy library projects with same project names and same repository.</li>

<br>The proxy library projects can use the same name as the source project
and be maintained under VCM in the same repository as the source projects.
Note that this is a non-standard arrangement for a VCM project. The source
and binary versions of a project need to be thought of as two permanently
separate branches in the version history: the source versions contains
source code but no binaries, whereas the binary versions contains binaries
but no source code. The differences are also reflected in the project's
.classpath file. In Eclipse, this can be achieved through the use of a
binaries-only stream separate from the usual stream in which the source
is maintained. In order to avoid generating unwanted outgoing or incoming
changes when switching from binary to source, proceed as follows: unshare
from binary stream; delete from workspace; load and share from source stream.
<ul>
<li>
Pro: Proxy library projects are also under VCM.</li>

<li>
Pro: One repository holds everything.</li>

<li>
Con: Project has non-standard dual version history.</li>

<li>
Con: Separate binaries-only stream means separate branch in version history.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
Of the various workspace setups discussed, the "Component plus libraries"
approach is the most straightforward, but also the weakest. It should work
well in cases where developers work on exactly the component they are assigned.
But it is not recommended in cases where developers assigned to one component
would need to patch or develop another component in the same workspace.
<p>The "Source for everything" approach is best for developers who are
all involved in the joint active development of all of the components.
There is a limit to how large it will scale, since the cost of recompiling
everything from source increases method the number and size of components.
It is not recommended in situations where many of the components are not
under active development; it will be more efficient to use pre-compiled
binary libraries for the static components.
<p>Approaches involving classpath variables do not have much to recommend
them. They share most of the disadvantages (and none of the advantages)
of using proxy library projects.
<p>The "Proxy Library Projects" workspace setup allows each developer to
work on their assigned component while providing ready access to all other
components. The arrangement is flexible in allowing easy switching from
using a component to patching it (or to actively developing it). The two
setups outlined in detail show how the proxy binary projects can be constructed
from a downloadable binary build or obtained from a version-managed repository.
Each has there pluses and minuses. The main drawback of using unshared
proxy library projects is the significant task of setting up a workspace
in the first place. This task would have to be automated by some means;
it would too tedious and error prone to have each developer create a workspace
from scratch. For shared proxy library projects, the tedium is in creating
new versions of the projects in their repository. This task could be automated
as part of the centralized build process.
<p>The "Stub Projects" workspace setup allows each developer to work on
their assigned component while providing placeholders for other components
that it depends on. The arrangement is flexible in allowing easy switching
from using a component to actively developing it by replacing the placeholder.
Unfortunately, this approach is fatally flawed because a compiler might
not have enough information to compile. The other drawbacks are their limited
useful of the stub projects (can't browse the component; can't patch the
component), and the ongoing need to create additional proxy projects to
fill in for the missing prerequisites as real source projects get added
to the workspace.

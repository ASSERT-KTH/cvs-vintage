<h2>
Workspace Structure</h2>
Last revised 11:15 Saturday September 8, 2001
<p>Original work item: "Make the build path less sensitive with regard
to whether a project is a source or a binary project. This is also related
to patching (i.e., adding a source folder to a binary project)."
<p>Related issue: support for extension directories containing many jars.
<p>There was much discussion. The underlying issue is how to structure
workspaces for significant Java development efforts. The Eclipse Project
is an example of such an effort, so the question is not merely of passing
interest. Since much of what is being developed in the Eclipse Project
are plug-ins, the question also touches on PDE's domain. However, some
aspects of the problem affect all significant Java development efforts
and not just ones for developing plug-ins. So we begin to investigating
those.
<h3>
Problem: Close Collaboration between Adjacent Teams</h3>
The following is an attempt to capture a familiar problem in a general
way that does not presume exactly how developers' workspaces are to be
structured. Consider the case of two components, with PUI dependent on
Core (imagine that Core is the core component, and UI is the corresponding
UI component built atop it). Now imagine that Core and UI are under active
development by two teams, with ownership split along component lines. For
maximum convenience to both teams, the teams would like to be able to do
the following:
<ul>
<li>
Each team would like to be able to work in a workspace that contains the
source code for their component and the binary equivalent (with attached
source) for all other components.</li>

<li>
Occasionally (e.g., during debugging) each team would like an easy way
to workaround (or perhaps induce) problems in another component.</li>

<li>
Occasionally each team would like an easy way for members to "join the
other team" and more actively work on another component.</li>
</ul>
Generalize from 2 to N the number of teams and components to get the full
extent of the problem.
<h3>
Problem: Large Numbers of Libraries</h3>
The following Eclipse Corner posting (Jon Skeet &lt;skeet@pobox.com> on
20.8.2001) describes one concern well:
<blockquote><i>Referencing a project's libraries in another project: The
project I'm working on uses a fairly large number of libraries (about 20
jar files, IIRC). I had hoped I'd be able to create one project which used
these libraries, and make all other projects have that project on their
build-paths to bring in the libraries - that way I wouldn't need to change
*every* project every time I added or removed a library. (It's not a common
operation, but even so...) Unfortunately, I can't get this to work - putting
project A on the classpath of project B only seems to put project A's individual
source/class files on the classpath for project B. I've tried adding as
an external jar and importing the jar file into the project, and had no
joy with either :(</i></blockquote>
Here is the arrangement:
<blockquote>project P1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/src; library lib1.jar;
library lib2.jar; ...; library lib20.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P1/bin
<br>project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P2/src; library lib1.jar;
library lib2.jar; ...; library lib20.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P2/bin</blockquote>
It is clear that the customer is looking for a way to deal with a set of
libraries that would be required by several projects, and was hoping that
required projects would give him that.
<h3>
Review: Required Projects</h3>
In Eclipse 1.0, the build classpath for a project P can contain an entry
for another project R, called a <b>required project</b>. Required projects
work as follows:
<ul>
<li>
The class files in the binary output directory of R are included, like
a library, on the effective build classpath of P. P's build classpath indicates
the order of this library relative to others. Other library (and project)
entries on the build classpath of R have no bearing on P; they are only
consulted to browse or build R.</li>

<li>
The names of required projects are recorded in the .classpath file, which
is under VCM. They are therefore shareable with other developers.</li>

<li>
Projects are presented as top level elements in the standard packages view.
A required project is not presented in the packages view as a child of
the project(s) that requires it.</li>

<li>
A project's list of required projects (a JDT core notion) is used to computed
the default value for the project's list of project references (a workspace
notion).</li>

<li>
Missing required projects and libraries, and unbound classpath variables,
generate problems reported against the project resource itself. These kind
of problems are detected by the Java model (rather than the Java builder).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Review: Classpath Entries</h3>
In Eclipse 1.0, a classpath is expressed as an array of classpath entries
(<tt>IClasspathEntry</tt>). There are four kinds of classpath entries:
<ul>
<li>
Source folder entry: denotes a project folder containing .java files. The
source folder must be contained inside the project where this classpath
entry is used. Source folder entries are generally used to componentize
the content of a given project (e.g. org.eclipse.jdt.core/Eclipse Java
Compiler/). The action of building a Java project will lead to populating
the project output folder with .class files corresponding to the .java
files which are contained in all the source folders present on this project
classpath. Note that the project root can itself be used as a source folder
(in which case the output folder is also the project itself).</li>

<li>
Library entry: denotes a binary JAR archive or binary folder. In case of
pointing at a JAR, the entry can also define a source attachment recommendation
(path to source archive, and path of source root inside this archive, e.g.
"c:/jre/src.jar" + "/src").</li>

<li>
Project entry: denotes a required project. When building, the required
project is built before the dependent project, and contributes its entire
output folder (i.e. all its produced .class files). Thus a project never
directly contributes its source files when building. However, for all source-based
functionalities (code assist, search, ...), a required project directly
contributes its sources (i.e. all of its source folders are exposed) so
that a build action is not mandatory to obtain accurate information; in
particular, when doing intensive code reorganization, code assist and search
will still perform accurately even if auto-build is turned off.</li>

<li>
Variable entry: indirect reference to either a library or a required project.
A variable entry uses a variable path of the form %variableName%[%pathSuffix%].
The variable name will be substituted with its actual value, which is a
workspace defined constant. The path suffix is an optional suffix which
can be appended to the variable value. PDE uses a global variable to represent
the Eclipse home directory, and path suffixes to reach the well-known libraries
(e.g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ECLIPSE_HOME/org.eclipse.jdt.core/jdtcore.jar").
Note that in a consistent manner with library entries, variable entries
can be provided with a variable source attachment recommendation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Investigation: Make Classpath Variables More Powerful</h3>
Would making classpath variables more powerful address some the problems
facing large scale Java development efforts?
<p>One idea would be to allow variables to be bound to a list of paths
instead of a single path. This would allow, for example, a single classpath
variable "BASE_LIBS" to be bound to the list of the paths of the library
jars lib1.jar; lib2.jar; ...; lib20.jar. Each project referencing this
classpath variable would thereby gain access to all the libraries:
<blockquote>project P1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/src; BASE_LIBS
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P1/bin
<br>project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P2/src; BASE_LIBS
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P2/bin</blockquote>
Changing the workspace binding of the classpath variable affects all projects
that reference the variable. This makes it easy to change the set of libraries
without having to change the projects individually.
<p>Since classpath variable bindings are local to the workspace, there
is no obvious automatic way by which these classpath variables would get
their bindings. The bindings would have to be configured for each workspace;
loading bindings from a file, or initializing them via a script, are feasible
options..
<p>The classpath variables currently bind to paths, and classpath entries
can contains paths that begin in a variable. Changing variables to bind
to a list of paths would be a major change, and would likely require reworking
much of existing API. We generally agreed that we would not pursue this
approach since it seems somewhat unlikely to solve much of the problem.
<h3>
Proposal: Explicitly Export Libraries from Required Projects</h3>
The proposal is to extend the required projects mechanism to allow a required
project to contribute more than just its binary output folder. Rather,
a project would be able to indicate that any of its libraries are to be
<b>exported</b>.
Exported libraries also become available to other projects in the workspace
that list this project as a required project.
<p>In the above example, the customer could instead have an arrangement
like:
<blockquote>project P1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1/source; project PLib
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P1/bin
<br>project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P2/source; project PLib
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P2/bin
<br>project PLib
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /PLib/source; <b>export</b>
library lib1.jar; ...; <b>export</b> library lib20.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /PLib/bin</blockquote>
What this means is that when P1 (similarly, P2) is built, the libraries
on its build classpath consists of /PLib/bin, lib1.jar, ..., lib20.jar.
<p>The modified semantics of a project P with a required project R are
as follows:
<ul>
<li>
There is an export flag associated with each library explicitly included
on the build classpath of a project. This flag is meaningful for both library
classpath entries (both internal and external), and required projects (it
is not associated with source and output entries.) The export flags are
recorded in the .classpath file, which is under VCM. These flags are therefore
shareable with other developers. (These flags can be added in a way that
does not invalidate existing R1.0 .classpath files.)</li>

<li>
The class files in the binary output directory of R, along with any libraries
explicitly exported on R's build classpath, are included as libraries on
the build classpath of P. P's build classpath indicates the placement of
this library relative to others; the output folder is always first, with
the exported libraries and projects included in the user-specified order.
Exported required projects are expanded inline. This ordering supports
scenarios where the output folder contains patches to the libraries. Non-exported
library entries and project entries on the build classpath of R have no
bearing on P.</li>

<li>
The names of required projects are recorded in the .classpath file, which
is under VCM. They are therefore shareable with other developers. (Unchanged.)</li>

<li>
Projects are presented as top level elements in the standard packages view.
A required project is not presented in the packages view as a child of
the project(s) that requires it; nor are the required project's exported
libraries.</li>

<li>
A project's list of required projects (a JDT core notion) is used to compute
the default value for the project's list of project references (a workspace
notion). (Unchanged.)</li>

<li>
Missing required projects and libraries, and unbound classpath variables,
generate problems reported against the project resource itself. These kind
of problems are detected by the Java model (rather than the Java builder).
(Unchanged.)</li>

<li>
Classpath problems pertaining to libraries exported from a required project
are reported only once, against the project closest to the problem. The
problematic entries are elided from the effective classpath of dependent
projects.</li>
</ul>
Example:
<blockquote>project P
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P/source; project R; library
plib.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P/bin
<br>project R
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /R/source; <b>export</b>
library rlib1.jar; library rlib2.jar; <b>export</b> project Q; <b>export</b>
library rlib3.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /R/bin
<br>project Q
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /Q/source
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /Q/bin</blockquote>
Effective build classpath of P:
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P/source; library
/R/bin; library rlib1.jar; library /Q/bin; library rlib3.jar; library plib.jar</blockquote>

<h4>
Exporting External Libraries</h4>
Relative to a given project, a library is internal iff the path to the
jar or folder lies inside the project's resource tree. Other libraries
are considered external to the project.
<p>Should projects be allowed to export arbitrary libraries, or should
exported libraries always be internal to the project?
<p>Restricting exports to internal libraries ensures that a project that
is to be used by other projects is somewhat self contained. If you load
such a project from a repository, you are guaranteed all the libraries
it exports will be contained therein.
<p>On the other hand, unrestricted exports are more flexible, and allow
a project to export a collection of libraries that are not necessarily
contained within the project's resource tree. (However, it is unclear whether
this additional flexibility would be useful.)
<p>We opted to allow unrestricted imports, but decided to simplify the
error processing by only reporting problems against the project with the
missing library (or required project) explicitly on its classpath. Any
missing entries would simply be omitted from the effective classpath calculation.for
dependent projects.
<h4>
Classpath Variables</h4>
A project's build classpath may include references to classpath variables
that get bound to libraries (or other projects). How do exports and variables
interact?
<p>The export flag could be associated either with the variable reference
or with the variable binding. If the export flag is associated with the
variable reference, it would indicate exporting whatever library the classpath
variable happened to be bound to on a given occasion. If the export flag
is associated with the variable binding itself, the library the classpath
variable happened to be bound to on a given occasion would be exported
conditionally on the flag in the binding. The proposal is to go with the
former (export flag with variable reference) since its semantics are somewhat
simpler and allow the export flag to be shared with other team members
(the bindings of classpath variables are not shareable).
<h4>
Exporting Auxillary Libraries</h4>
Note that explicit exports also address another problem that arises when
a project needs to export a pre-built library in addition to the results
of compiling its source files (the Eclipse debugger's jdi.jar is a fine
instance of this). In Eclipse 1.0, only the class files in the project's
binary output folder are exported to dependent projects. This proposal
allows a project to export any number of additional libraries as required.
<h4>
Exporting Projects</h4>
By exporting other projects, a project can consolidate and concentrate
the outputs from several other projects:..
<blockquote>project P1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P/source; export library
/P1/lib1.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P1/bin
<br>project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P2/source; export library /P2/lib2.jar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P2/bin
<br>project P1andP2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = source /P1andP2/source; export project
P1; export project P2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; output /P1andP2/bin</blockquote>
Effective build classpath of P1andP2 includes everything exported from
both P1 and P2:
<blockquote>build classpath = library /P1andP2/source; library /P1/bin;
library /P1/lib1.jar; library /P2/bin; library /P2/lib2.jar
<br>output /P1andP2/bin</blockquote>

<h3>
Proposal: Admit Library Projects which Contain No Source Code</h3>
One objection to this whole approach is that the Java project is being
hijacked. In the original design, a Java project is a buildable container
of Java source code. The addition of exported libraries starts to turn
the project into something more general. If we are comfortable with this
general trend, there are ways that the design can embrace it more whole-heartedly.
<p>The above proposal to expand the semantics of required project creates
a new role for a Java project as a container of libraries. This notion
of <b>library project</b> is rounded out by allowing Java projects without
source or output folders. The build classpath of a library project orders
the list of exported libraries and projects (and provides the additional
context required for browsing the project itself).
<p>In our example, the library project could be expressed more directly
without having to postulate source and output folders which are completely
unmotivated in this case:
<p>project PLib
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build classpath = <b>export</b> library lib1.jar;
...; <b>export</b> library lib20.jar
<p>A library project is recognizable simply by the absence of source folders
on the build classpath. (We considered adding a new flag to the project
to explicitly mark library projects, but decided this was not necessary
and would be confusing.)
<p>Note that library projects are not "buildable" in any meaningful sense
since they lack source code to compile (and without source code there is
no pressing need for a binary output folder). However, there still needs
to be a mechanism for detecting and reporting errors in the build classpath
for library projects. Except for such checks, the Java incremental project
builder should ignore library projects.
<p>The following kinds of entries on the build classpath of a library project
would serve these purposes:
<ul>
<li>
Source folders - a library project has no source folders, by definition.</li>

<li>
Output folders - not needed for a library project.</li>

<li>
Unexported libraries - provides context when browsing this project.</li>

<li>
Unexported required projects - provides context when browsing this project.</li>
</ul>
However, the API (and UI?) should allow the information in all fields to
be maintained even for library projects, possibly to facilitate switching
a project between a regular and a library project.
<p>The workspace must compute an input delta even for incremental project
builders that ignore the delta they are handed. We considered whether we
should go one step further and remove the Java builder from a library project's
list of incremental project builders. This would make it crystal clear
that there is no Java building going on, and it would reduce workspace
memory footprint because the workspace would not need to remember the shape
of the resource tree at the time of the last build. However, if the builder
was removed for library projects, there would need to be mechanism to add
it if the classpath was changed to include a source project. We decided
that we should simply avoid the additional hassles and leave the Java builder
installed for all Java projects.
<h3>
Background</h3>
From Philippe Mulet 08/31/2001 12:13 PM
<p>I also think this has to be a basic mechanism at the JavaCore level,
which the PDE can then surface to plugin writers.
<br>I would like to see this one addressed asap, so that it is possible
to share projects transparently at least amongst us.
<p>=======
<p>From Erich Gamma on 08/31/2001 12:43 PM
<p>Here is some more input on our favorite topic "make the build class
path less sensitive
<br>with regard to whether a project is a source or binary project".
<p>Our conclusion in SNZ was that this boils down to a PDE project layout
issue (binary
<br>projects etc). However, the EC discussion from below illustrates a
use case for allowing to export
<br>JARs in addition to the output folder from a project, that is independent
of PDE.
<br>The scenario is similar to the WSAD scenario with extension dirs. If
we support to
<br>contribute contained JARs from a project then this problem would be
addressed.
<p>We should therefore reconsider the solution independent of the PDE issue.
<br>If I do that then I come to the conclusion that the proposed mechanism
is valuable
<br>and I suggest to go ahead with specifying it in detail.
<p>Thoughts?
<p>=======
<br>From Jon Skeet &lt;skeet@pobox.com> on Eclipse Corner 20.8.2001
<p>Referencing a project's libraries in another project:
<br>The project I'm working on uses a fairly large number of libraries
<br>(about 20 jar files, IIRC). I had hoped I'd be able to create one
<br>project which used these libraries, and make all other projects have
<br>that project on their build-paths to bring in the libraries - that
way I
<br>wouldn't need to change *every* project every time I added or removed
a
<br>library. (It's not a common operation, but even so...) Unfortunately,
I
<br>can't get this to work - putting project A on the classpath of project
B
<br>only seems to put project A's individual source/class files on the
<br>classpath for project B. I've tried adding as an external jar and
<br>importing the jar file into the project, and had no joy with either
:(

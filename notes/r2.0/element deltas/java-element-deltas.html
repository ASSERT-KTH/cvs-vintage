<h2>
Java Element Deltas</h2>
Last revised 12:00 Thursday September 6, 2001
<p>Original work item: "IJavaElementDelta should carry information about
marker changes (ProblemMarkers)."
<h3>
Markers and Java Elements</h3>
The workspace allows markers to be associated with resources. The Java
compiler associates Java problem markers with Java source files; these
markers locate the error within the compilation unit by source character
position.
<p>The Java model does not directly support markers on Java elements. It
does provide a means (<tt>ICompilationUnit.getElementAt</tt>) for mapping
from a source character position within a compilation unit resource to
the nearest enclosing Java element. Since all Java problem markers carry
a source character position, any Java problem marker can be mapped to the
nearest enclosing Java element. In most cases, this element will be a fine-grained
Java element corresponding to a declaration of a Java method, field, type,
or import. In the worst case, it maps to the compilation unit element itself.
Thus it is always possible in principle to associate markers with Java
elements.
<p>The Java UI visually annotates Java elements that have problems (with
a red X).
<p>The cost of mapping from a marker position to a fine-grained Java element
requires opening (and parsing) the compilation unit. Once opened, additional
markers within the same compilation unit can be mapped with negligible
additional cost.
<h3>
Java Element Deltas</h3>
Unlike workspace resource deltas, Java element deltas do not currently
include information about marker changes.
<p>The Java UI needs to maintain the visual annotations on Java elements
that have problems.
<p>There are three kinds of Java element deltas issued:
<ol>
<li>
By the Java model when <tt>IWorkingCopy.commit</tt> is called to save a
compilation unit working copy.</li>

<li>
By the Java model when <tt>IWorkingCopy.reconcile</tt> is called during
editing.</li>

<li>
By the Java model in response to notification of a workspace resource delta
affecting a compilation unit resource.</li>
</ol>
The first two kinds of Java element delta are always issued against fine-grained
Java elements. The previous fine-grained structure of the compilation unit
is compared to the current fine-grained structure. These deltas are recognizable
as kind <tt>CHANGED</tt> at the compilation unit level with <tt>F_CHILDREN</tt>
flag set and <tt>F_CONTENT</tt> flag <i>not</i> set.
<p>The last kind of Java element delta is never fine-grained; it goes no
finer than the compilation unit element itself. This is because the fine-grained
structure of the previous state of the compilation unit is not available
(the Java model does not necessarily have a record of the previous structure
(although it <i>might </i>be in an internal cache), and cannot compute
it since it does not a copy of the previous state of the compilation unit).
These deltas are recognizable as kind <tt>CHANGED</tt> at the compilation
unit level with <tt>F_CHILDREN</tt> flag <i>not </i>set and with <tt>F_CONTENT</tt>
flag set.
<h3>
Markers and Java Element Deltas</h3>
Java problems markers on Java compilation units originate when the Java
builder is called. These markers are associated with Java compilation unit
files, and come to the attention of the Java model via a problem delta
associated with the resource delta that follows the build. The Java builder
only deletes or adds Java problem markers; it never changes existing ones.
The Java builder does not decorate Java problem markers with information
other than the source character position.
<p><tt>(IWorkingCopy.reconcile</tt> also returns a set of tranisent markers.)
<p>When the user opens a compilation unit, the Java editor creates and
locates visual markers corresponding to the Java problem markers. These
visual markers are sticky, and move around as the text is edited.
<p>When the user navigates into an already open compilatation unit from
a problem marker in the Tasks view, the Java editor automatically adjusts
the positions to account for recent edits.
<p>When the Java editor saves a compilation unit, it permanently adjusts
the source positions of Java problem markers associated with the corresponding
compilation unit. This is done because the next build may be a ways off
and these markers show up in the Tasks view (the Java editor might be closed).
<p>Java element deltas also carry information about non-Java resources;
this is surfaced by <tt>IJavaElementDelta.getResourceDeltas</tt>. This
works as follows: when a non-Java resource is affected, the corresponding
resource delta is exposed on the nearest parent Java element. For files
directly under the project, the resource delta will be associated with
Java element delta for the <tt>IJavaProject</tt>; for files sitting in
the same folder as a Java source file, the resource delta will be associated
with Java element delta for the <tt>IPackageFragment</tt>; for files sitting
inside a source folder but not in any package fragment, the resource delta
will be associated with Java element delta for the <tt>IPackageFragmentRoot</tt>
(this includes the case where the project itself is a package fragment
root. Thus the <tt>IJavaElementDelta.getResourceDeltas</tt> mechanism is
only of use for discovering non-resource deltas; it is not useful for discovering
marker changes to resources corresponding to Java elements.
<p>Thus the only way a client can find out about most marker deltas is
to register its own resource change listener with the workspace. Since
the client would still need to register a Java model change listener, having
to do raises the question of relative ordering of these two notifications
(there is no guarantee which will comes first).
<h3>
Proposal: Expose corresponding resource deltas on Java element delta</h3>
The proposed change is to improve the Java element delta to expose the
corresponding resource deltas whenever they are available. This would be
done via the following new method on <tt>IJavaElementDelta</tt>:
<p><tt>/**</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* Returns the workspace resource delta for the resource that
corresponds directly to the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* Java element, or &lt;code>null&lt;/code> if either there
is no resource that corresponds</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* to the Java element, or there is a corresponding resource
but there is no resource delta</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* for it.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* &lt;p></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* Note that a Java element delta that does not arise from
a workspace resource delta will always</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* return &lt;code>null&lt;/code>.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* &lt;/p></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* &lt;p></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* If the result is non-&lt;code>null&lt;/code>, then</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* &lt;code>getCorrespondingResourceDelta().getResource()&lt;/code>
is the same resource as</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* &lt;code>getElement().getCorrespondingResource()&lt;/code>.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* &lt;/p></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;*</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;* @return the corresponding workspace resource delta, or
&lt;code>null&lt;/code> if not applicable or none</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;*/</tt>
<br><tt>public IResourceDelta getCorrespondingResourceDelta();</tt>
<p>Resource deltas will be available when the Java element delta results
from the Java model receiving a resource change notification. When this
happens, the resource delta for the corresponding will be made available
from the Java element delta for the Java element:
<ul>
<li>
Java project: expose resource delta for the corresponding project resource.</li>

<li>
Java compilation unit: expose resource delta for the corresponding Java
source file.</li>

<li>
Java class file: expose resource delta for the corresponding Java class
file.</li>

<li>
Java package fragment root: expose resource delta for the corresponding
source folder, jar or zip file.</li>

<li>
Java package fragment: expose resource delta for the corresponding package
folder under a source package fragment root.</li>
</ul>
Note that the proposed API change would not break compatibility with Eclipse
1.0. It adds a new method to an interface that is not intended to be implemented
by clients.
<p>With the proposed change, a client of the Java model would be able to
discover marker changes to both Java and non-Java resource by registering
for Java model changes and composing <tt>IJavaElementDelta.getCorrespondingResourceDelta</tt>
and <tt>IResourceDelta.getMarkerDeltas</tt>. These marker changes will
only be present on Java element deltas stemming from workspace resource
deltas. They are no marker deltas associated with fine-grained Java element
deltas arising from working copy reconciliation or saving (no markers have
changes).
<p>Other things we considered:
<ul>
<li>
For the case where a coarse-grained Java element deltas is issued, add
marker delta information to Java elements finer than the compilation unit.
This is not feasible because there would be no way to compute fine-grained
Java element or marker deltas since the Java model has no "before" state
to compare against.</li>

<li>
For the cases where a fine-grained Java element deltas is issued, add marker
delta information to Java elements finer than the compilation unit. This
is not feasible because the markers aren't changing in this case, and the
Java model itself is not in the business of adjusting markers.</li>
</ul>

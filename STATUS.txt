-Other Committers-

    * Niall Pemberton (niallp at apache.org) [NEW]


-PMC Actions-

* Niall Pemberton is elected as a Struts Committer.

* Two new subprojects (our first) are approved. One that utilizes BSF so that "Actions" can be scripted rather than expressed as Java code. Another is a port of Cocoon's Control Flow to Struts. Infrastructure details are being addressed. The initial code for both projects were developed by a Struts PMC member, Don Brown, who is filing a code grant to the ASF. Both codebases are ready for release testing.


-Significant threads-

* Compiling Struts from source and running the Cactus tests continues to be a challenge for some developers. Completing the move to Maven should help.


-Releases-

* Stable release: 1.1 (29 June 2003).

* Next anticipated release: 1.2.1

* Anticipated time-frame (if any): Awaiting stable release of a dependency (Commons Validator).


-Roadmap-

* Struts 1.x will remain based on Servlet 1.2/JSP 1.1 (evolution).

* Struts 1.3.x will introduce the "Struts Chain" request processor. Some packages, like the taglibs, will be released as separate subprojects.

* Struts 2.x will be based on Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 (revolution).

* The Apache Struts repository will be rationalized to accomodate subprojects and Maven once a stable Struts 1.2.x release is available. Subprojects will be the unit of release. Each subproject will be a distinct Maven "artifact". Pending this step, the website and repository remain under jakarta.apache.org.

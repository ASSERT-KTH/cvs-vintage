* Initial draft of bylaws page [http://struts.apache.org/bylaws.html]. Not linked into other documentation yet as other pages are to follow.

-Roadmap-

* Struts 1.x will remain based on Servlet 1.2/JSP 1.1 (evolution). 

* Struts 1.3.x will introduce the "Struts Chain" request processor. Some packages, like the taglibs, will be released as separate subprojects.

* Struts 2.x will be based on Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 (revolution).

* For more see <http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/status.html>.


-Bugzilla-

* Open "problem" reports:       9 [#26322 .. #28358]
* Open "enhancement" reports: 237 [#  866 .. #26639] (28 with patch)
* Open "LATER" reports:        23 [#17977 .. #26895]


-Mailing list subscriptions-

* User 1876
* User digest: 917
* Dev: 706


-Significant threads-

* Some interim releases, such as the latest "alpha" Validator release, are being made available through cvs.apache.org/repository/, which is assisting with our move to a Maven build environment.

* Links to external resources, formerly part of the documentation, are being moved to the Wiki. There are now at least 19 books devoted to Apache Struts, including Struts for Dummies (we have arrived!).

* We'd like to require wiki logins, to retain attribution, but it does not seem to be an option.

* The TLP transition is going slowly but smoothly. We plan to refactor some packages into subprojects with their own release cycles, such as the taglibs.

* 72 (since 8 Apr)

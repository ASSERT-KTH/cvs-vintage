Creating and populating the database
====================================

The ant build has a target called "create-db" that is normally used to create
and populate the scarab database. Unfortunately, fora  variety of reasons
this does not work with PostgreSQL. Instead there is a shell script that can
be used to perform the same job, <install dir>/src/sql/create-db.sh. Here
are the steps you should follow:

1. If you are on Windows, download and install Cygwin. Alternatively, convert
   the shell script to a batch file.

2. Ensure that 'psql', 'createdb' and 'dropdb' are in your path.

3. From <install dir>/build, run 'ant sql-current-db'.

3. 'cd' to <install dir>/src/sql.

4. Run 'create-db.sh', passing the details of the target database as parameters.
   For example,
   
     create-db.sh --host monkey --port 5432 --username pgsql --password --name scarab_test
   
   will create a database called "scarab_test" on the database server "monkey:5432",
   connecting as the user "pgsql". The "--password" option indicates that the script
   should ask for a password when required.
   
   More details about the various options can be found by running 'createdb.sh --help'.

Once you complete these steps, you'll be able to run Scarab against the newly created
database.


Database permissions
====================

Things get a little tricky if you create the database with one user, and
then Scarab connects as a different user. The problem is one of database
permissions: Scarab requires full rights to all the tables in the Scarab
database. Unfortunately, it seems that the permissions can only be granted
on a per-table basis. There may be a script in the future that helps update
the table permissions, but for now it has to be done manually.

Of course, if Scarab connects as the user that created the database, you
won't have this problem at all!
